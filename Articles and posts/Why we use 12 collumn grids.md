Alternative title: Number 12 and it's importance to web design

The number 12 is divisible by 6 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and by itself, making it a [superior highly composite number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_highly_composite_number) (a natural number that has many divisors)
This makes it very convenient in *division* as you can make many possible combinations out of it: halves 12/6, thirds 12/4, quarters 12/3, sixths 12/2, twelves 12/12 and single unit 12/1

The entire civilized world uses the decimal system. Would not a base-10 Bootstrap grid layout system for rows and columns make more logical sense?
Actually, it wouldnâ€™t. And _math_ is the reason why.
Bootstrap uses a 12-column layout because the number 12 has more divisors than any number before it or after it, up until the number 60.
Number 10 is only divisible by 1, 5 and itself, making it 3 times less flexible than 12

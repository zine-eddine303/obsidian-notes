# Chapter 1
We believe a business model can best be described through nine basic building blocks that show the logic of how a company intends to make money. The nine blocks cover the four main areas of a business: customers, offer, infrastructure, and financial viability. The business model is like a blueprint for a strategy to be implemented through organizational structures, processes, and systems.

## 1. Customer Segments: 
An organization serves one or several Customer Segments. In order to better satisfy customers, **a company may group them into distinct segments with common needs, common behaviors, or other attributes.** A business model may define one or several large or small Customer Segments. An organization must make a conscious decision about which segments to serve and which segments to ignore. Once this decision is made, a business model can be carefully designed around a strong understanding of specific customer needs.

Customer groups represent separate segments if: 
   - Their needs require and justify a distinct offer 
   - They are reached through different Distribution Channels 
   - They require different types of relationships 
   - They have substantially different profitabilities 
   - They are willing to pay for different aspects of the offer

```
Our primitive custommer segmets could be:
- Merchants who need ecommerce websites
- Buisiness owners who need to showcase their business (vitrine)
```
## 2. Value Propositions: 
It seeks to solve customer problems and satisfy customer needs with value propositions.
The Value Propositions Building Block describes the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific Customer Segment The Value Proposition is the reason why customers turn to one company over another. It solves a customer problem or satisfi es a customer need. Each Value Proposition consists of a selected bundle of products and/or services that caters to the requirements of a specifi c Customer Segment. In this sense, the Value Proposition is an aggregation, or bundle, of benefits that a company offers customers. Some Value Propositions may be innovative and represent a new or disruptive offer. Others may be similar to existing market offers, but with added features and attributes.

```
There are many types of value proposition (view page 29), in our case our service could have these types:
- Customization
- Design
- Cost reduction (the custommer can get a website designed, )
```
## 3. Channels: 
Value propositions are delivered to customers through communication, distribution, and sales Channels.
## 4. Customer Relationships: 
Customer relationships are established and maintained with each Customer Segment.
## 5. Revenue Streams:
Revenue streams result from value propositions successfully offered to customers.
## 6. Key Resources:
Key resources are the assets required to oâ„¦er and deliver the previously described elements . . .
## 7. Key Activities: 
. . . by performing a number of Key Activities.
## 8. Key Partnerships: 
Some activities are outsourced and some resources are acquired outside the enterprise.
## 9. Cost Structure: 
The business model elements result in the cost structure

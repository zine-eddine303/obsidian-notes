# Resume best practices

- Resumes with LinkedIn profiles get more chances of hiring, but only those with sophisticated profiles
	- [LinkedIn profile tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcfGWi8Qywk&list=PLo-kPya_Ww2zqOZVXMNQCJeTNAaan8GcW&index=2)

- Including relevant soft skills is usually neglected. Here are some you can use, and look for more recent studies and sources.

	- https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/10-top-soft-skills-to-master-for-2020-if-you-want-a-raise-promotion-or-new-job.html

- Include metrics in your accomplishments, use the XYZ formula: Accomplished X as measured by Y, by doing Z.
	- For our case, since we have no real measurements, we can say:
		  - Being in charge of [the visual aspect of the project] Lead to a [57%] increase in productivity for the development team, [beacause they could focus on what they do best]
		  - A [57%] increase in productivity for the development team, by creating a consistent design system and guidelines
		  - Increased user experience by [40%] by analyzing user flows and enhancing them and implementing consistent workflows (forms, navigation, correct phrasing, localization...)
		  - Significant increase of software usability by deep testing and reporting issues,  errors and bugs, and suggesting better approaches.
		  - Increased brand awareness by creating consistent and standing out brand identity across all supports
		  - Increase of understanding of design principles by developers by informing them

- Make the resume length between 475 and 600 words

- Don't use buzzwords or resume cliches (Motivated, creative thinker, Innovative...)
	- Search google: buzzwords and resume cliches, and remove those from your resume 

- Adapt your resume to each job you are applying for 

- **Personal tip**: if I include my masters degree in electrical engineering, it might look like I am overqualified, and like I underestimated myself. Let that sink in...

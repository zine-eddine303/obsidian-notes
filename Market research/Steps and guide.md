# **Step 0: Crafting a Survey Strategy**

#### **A. Define Your Survey Goals**

Your survey should address specific, actionable questions, such as:

1. **Clients' Needs:** What are the main problems they want a website to solve?
2. **Spending Mentality:** How much are they willing to invest in a website?
3. **Decision Factors:** What influences their choice of a web designer? (e.g., cost, design quality, speed).
4. **Competitor Insights:** What services do they currently use, and why?

---

#### **B. Determine Your Target Respondents**

1. **Who to Survey:**
    - Business owners in the identified industries.
    - Decision-makers like operations managers or agency owners.
2. **Where to Find Them:**
    - LinkedIn for professionals (filter by location and industry).
    - Facebook Groups for entrepreneurs in Algeria.
    - Local business directories or networks.
    - Your existing network (e.g., ask your past clients to share the survey).

---

#### **C. Design Your Survey Questions**

To make your survey effective:

1. **Keep it Short (5–10 minutes max):** People are more likely to respond if it's brief.
2. **Use a Mix of Question Types:**
    - **Multiple Choice:** Easy to answer and analyze.
    - **Rating Scales (1–5):** Gauge preferences or importance.
    - **Open-Ended Questions:** Gather detailed insights but limit to 1–2.

---

#### **D. Draft Survey Questions**

Here’s a sample structure based on your goals:

1. **Demographics:**
    
    - What type of business do you own? (Multiple choice: E-commerce, Industrial services, Travel agency, etc.).
    - How long have you been in business? (Less than a year, 1–3 years, etc.).
2. **Website Needs:**
    
    - Do you currently have a website? (Yes/No).
    - If yes, what is your main issue with your current website? (Multiple choice: Outdated design, poor functionality, etc.).
    - If no, why haven’t you built one yet? (Cost, don’t see the value, don’t know how to start, etc.).
    - What is the primary purpose of your website? (Multiple choice: Sell products, showcase expertise, etc.).
3. **Spending Mentality:**
    
    - How much are you willing to spend on a new website? (Multiple choice: <20,000 DA, 20,000–50,000 DA, etc.).
    - What matters most when choosing a web designer? (Ranking question: Price, design quality, speed, etc.).
4. **Competitor Insights:**
    
    - Have you worked with a web designer before? (Yes/No).
    - If yes, what was your experience like? (Open-ended).

---

#### **E. Choose a Survey Platform**

- **Google Forms:** Free, simple to use, and shareable.
- **Typeform:** Great for a modern, user-friendly design.
- **SurveyMonkey:** Offers more advanced analytics.

---

#### **F. Distribute Your Survey**

1. **Direct Outreach:**
    - Reach out to potential respondents on LinkedIn or via email.
    - Use a friendly message to explain your purpose (e.g., “Hi, I’m conducting research to improve web design services for Algerian businesses. Your input would be incredibly valuable!”).
2. **Social Media:**
    - Post in relevant Facebook Groups for entrepreneurs or business owners in Algeria.
    - Share on your own social media, asking for responses or referrals.
3. **Networking:**
    - Leverage local business events or forums to promote your survey.

---

#### **G. Analyze Survey Results**

- After collecting responses, categorize answers based on your research goals:
    - **Needs and priorities (high, medium, low):** Use this to refine your service offerings.
    - **Spending mentality:** Use this to set competitive but realistic pricing.
    - **Common complaints about competitors:** Highlight how your services solve these issues.

---

#### **Task for You:**

1. Draft your survey using the structure above.
2. Choose your platform (e.g., Google Forms).
3. Create a distribution plan (list groups, contacts, or platforms to share).

Once you’ve done this, share your draft survey or the link with me, and I’ll review and suggest any improvements!

This is excellent work! Based on this, we can create a **targeting strategy** that focuses on the highest-priority industries while tailoring your approach for each. Here's how I interpret your findings:

---

# **Step 3: Prioritize and Plan Your Targeting Strategy**

## **Top Priorities (High Urgency + High Budget Potential):**

1. **Industrial Services/Products**
    
    - **Why:** These businesses need a professional website to establish credibility, showcase expertise, and attract serious clients. They are more likely to invest in quality design and UX since it directly affects their reputation.
    - **Strategy:**
        - Highlight your ability to create clean, professional designs that enhance credibility.
        - Focus on ease of navigation and strong contact forms.
        - Leverage your technical background (e.g., knowledge of technical industries) to relate to their needs.
    - **Marketing Tactics:**
        - Target industrial businesses through LinkedIn, industry-specific forums, and networking events.
        - Create case studies or portfolio pieces for this niche.
2. **E-commerce**
    
    - **Why:** Selling online is essential for these businesses, but many may be budget-sensitive. Focus on efficient, cost-effective solutions.
    - **Strategy:**
        - Emphasize fast delivery and your ability to create user-friendly, conversion-optimized websites.
        - Offer scalable packages, such as a starter website with the option to expand later.
    - **Marketing Tactics:**
        - Promote on platforms where small businesses gather (e.g., Facebook Groups, forums).
        - Highlight your ability to set up e-commerce websites using Shopify or WordPress.

---

## **Secondary Priorities (Medium Urgency + Medium Budget Potential):**

3. **Travel Agencies**
    - **Why:** A website is a great tool for selling packages and attracting tourists, but the urgency is moderate since many agencies rely on offline sales or social media.
    - **Strategy:**
        - Focus on mobile-friendly designs and online booking features.
        - Highlight your UX skills, ensuring users can easily find and book travel offers.
    - **Marketing Tactics:**
        - Attend travel expos or network with agency owners.
        - Emphasize fast turnaround for seasonal campaigns.

---

## **Low Priorities (Low Budget Potential or Urgency):**

4. **Marketing Agencies**
    
    - **Why:** They need websites but often prioritize price over quality. Many rely on their social media portfolio instead.
    - **Strategy:**
        - Position yourself as a partner by offering to handle their web design projects for their clients.
        - Showcase your UX expertise, highlighting how better design can attract more clients.
    - **Marketing Tactics:**
        - Propose collaboration deals with marketing agencies rather than directly selling them a website.
5. **Real Estate Agencies**
    
    - **Why:** Websites are useful for showcasing properties but aren't seen as essential. Social media often suffices for these businesses.
    - **Strategy:**
        - Focus on automation features (e.g., forms for scheduling visits, filters for property searches).
        - Target higher-end real estate agencies that cater to wealthier clients.

# **Step 4: Research Competitors in These Industries**

To ensure you stand out, we now need to analyze competitors in these niches:

- **Questions to Answer:**
    1. Who are the main competitors targeting these industries in Algeria?
    2. What do their websites or services lack? (e.g., poor UX, slow delivery, expensive pricing).
    3. How do they position themselves? (e.g., premium services vs. budget-friendly).
    4. What pricing models do they use?

## **Task:**

1. Use Google and social media to search for web designers/developers in Algeria.
2. Analyze at least **3 competitors’ websites or profiles**:
    - What industries they target.
    - What services they offer.
    - How their designs compare to your strengths.

Once you’ve gathered this data, share it, and I’ll help you refine your differentiation strategy!

## Results
- Who are the main competitors targeting these industries in Algeria?
  Mostly Digital agencies who offer a variety of digital services (web design and development, app design and development, web hosting and domain services, marketing, branding, SEO, social media marketing, content creation, advertising on social media) 
- What do their websites or services lack?
  Poor UI and UX, Poor/no maintenance, some websites are down/not functionning correctly
- How do they position themselves?
  professional and reliable
- What pricing models do they use?
  ==???==
- What industries they target?
  They don't have a specific niche, but many of them have created ecommerce websites for their customers which is normal because most businesses who need websites are ecommerce businesses
- How their designs compare to your strengths.
  most of them use templates and modify on them, and most of the times they do a bad job in customizing them, they either under-customize them (the barely change anything in the templates) which makes the websites lack identity and originality. Or they customize them in a bad way and an inconsistent way.
  Some others design them from scratch and make them very bad design and functionality
  A very small minority (i only found 3 or 4) make good designs, and actually know what a good website should look like.

When most people decide to learn something, they go and pay for workshops, ask people to show them how, pay for online courses. They lack the skills and the ability to: 
1. Research a topic
2. Self learn
3. Find useful resources to learn
4. Find workarounds to avoid paying for digital services like software or learning resources
This makes me different and more advantageous than most people, specially here in Algeria.

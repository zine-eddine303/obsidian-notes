# Chapter 1
We believe a business model can best be described through nine basic building blocks that show the logic of how a company intends to make money. The nine blocks cover the four main areas of a business: customers, offer, infrastructure, and financial viability. The business model is like a blueprint for a strategy to be implemented through organizational structures, processes, and systems.
## 1. Customer Segments: 
An organization serves one or several Customer Segments. In order to better satisfy customers, **a company may group them into distinct segments with common needs, common behaviors, or other attributes.** A business model may define one or several large or small Customer Segments. An organization must make a conscious decision about which segments to serve and which segments to ignore. Once this decision is made, a business model can be carefully designed around a strong understanding of specific customer needs.

Customer groups represent separate segments if: 
- Their needs require and justify a distinct offer 
- They are reached through different Distribution Channels 
- They require different types of relationships 
- They have substantially different profitabilities 
- They are willing to pay for different aspects of the offer

```
Our primitive custommer segmets could be:
- Merchants who need ecommerce websites
- Buisiness owners who need to showcase their business (vitrine)
```
## 2. Value Propositions: 
It seeks to solve customer problems and satisfy customer needs with value propositions.
The Value Propositions Building Block describes the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific Customer Segment The Value Proposition is the reason why customers turn to one company over another. It solves a customer problem or satisfi es a customer need. Each Value Proposition consists of a selected bundle of products and/or services that caters to the requirements of a specifi c Customer Segment. In this sense, the Value Proposition is an aggregation, or bundle, of benefits that a company offers customers. Some Value Propositions may be innovative and represent a new or disruptive offer. Others may be similar to existing market offers, but with added features and attributes.

```
There are many types of value proposition (view page 29), in our case our service could have these types:
- Customization
- Design
- Cost reduction (the custommer can get a website designed, developped and hosted all in one place, instead of doing each task individually which raises costs)
```
## 3. Channels: 
Value propositions are delivered to customers through communication, distribution, and sales Channels.
The Channels Building Block describes how a company communicates with and reaches its Customer Segments to deliver a Value Proposition Communication, distribution, and sales Channels comprise a company's interface with customers. Channels are customer touch points that play an important role in the customer experience. Channels serve several functions, including:
* Raising awareness among customers about a company’s products and services
* Helping customers evaluate a company’s Value Proposition
* Allowing customers to purchase specific products and services
* Delivering a Value Proposition to customers
* Providing post-purchase customer support

**Finding the right mix of Channels to satisfy how customers want to be reached is crucial in bringing a Value Proposition to market.**

**We can distinguish between direct Channels and indirect ones, as well as between owned Channels and partner Channels.**
An organization can choose between reaching its customers through its own Channels, through partner Channels, or through a mix of both. Owned Channels can be direct, such as an in-house sales force or a Web site, or they can be indirect, such as retail stores owned or operated by the organization. Partner Channels are indirect and span a whole range of options, such as wholesale distribution, retail, or partner-owned Web sites. Partner Channels lead to lower margins, but they allow an organization to expand its reach and benefit from partner strengths. Owned Channels and particularly direct ones have higher margins, but can be costly to put in place and to operate. The trick is to find the right balance between the different types of Channels, to integrate them in a way to create a great customer experience, and to maximize revenues.

## 7. Key Activities: 
. . . by performing a number of Key Activities.
## 8. Key Partnerships:

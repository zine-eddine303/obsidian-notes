# Chapter 1
We believe a business model can best be described through nine basic building blocks that show the logic of how a company intends to make money. The nine blocks cover the four main areas of a business: customers, offer, infrastructure, and financial viability. The business model is like a blueprint for a strategy to be implemented through organizational structures, processes, and systems.
## 1. Customer Segments (CS)
An organization serves one or several Customer Segments. In order to better satisfy customers, **a company may group them into distinct segments with common needs, common behaviors, or other attributes.** A business model may define one or several large or small Customer Segments. An organization must make a conscious decision about which segments to serve and which segments to ignore. Once this decision is made, a business model can be carefully designed around a strong understanding of specific customer needs.

Customer groups represent separate segments if: 
- Their needs require and justify a distinct offer 
- They are reached through different Distribution Channels 
- They require different types of relationships 
- They have substantially different profitabilities 
- They are willing to pay for different aspects of the offer

	Our primitive custommer segmets could be:
	- Merchants who need ecommerce websites
	- Buisiness owners who need to showcase their business (vitrine)

## 2. Value Propositions (VP)
It seeks to solve customer problems and satisfy customer needs with value propositions.
The Value Propositions Building Block describes the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific Customer Segment The Value Proposition is the reason why customers turn to one company over another. It solves a customer problem or satisfies a customer need. Each Value Proposition consists of a selected bundle of products and/or services that caters to the requirements of a specific Customer Segment. In this sense, the Value Proposition is an aggregation, or bundle, of benefits that a company offers customers. Some Value Propositions may be innovative and represent a new or disruptive offer. Others may be similar to existing market offers, but with added features and attributes.


	There are many types of value proposition (view page 29), in our case our service could have these types:
	- Customization
	- Design
	- Cost reduction (the custommer can get a website designed, developped and hosted all in one place, instead of doing each task individually which raises costs)

## 3. Channels (CH)
Value propositions are delivered to customers through communication, distribution, and sales Channels.
The Channels Building Block describes how a company communicates with and reaches its Customer Segments to deliver a Value Proposition Communication, distribution, and sales Channels comprise a company's interface with customers. Channels are customer touch points that play an important role in the customer experience. Channels serve several functions, including:
* Raising awareness among customers about a company’s products and services
* Helping customers evaluate a company’s Value Proposition
* Allowing customers to purchase specific products and services
* Delivering a Value Proposition to customers
* Providing post-purchase customer support

**Finding the right mix of Channels to satisfy how customers want to be reached is crucial in bringing a Value Proposition to market.**

**We can distinguish between direct Channels and indirect ones, as well as between owned Channels and partner Channels.**
An organization can choose between reaching its customers through its own Channels, through partner Channels, or through a mix of both. Owned Channels can be direct, such as an in-house sales force or a Web site, or they can be indirect, such as retail stores owned or operated by the organization. Partner Channels are indirect and span a whole range of options, such as wholesale distribution, retail, or partner-owned Web sites. Partner Channels lead to lower margins, but they allow an organization to expand its reach and benefit from partner strengths. Owned Channels and particularly direct ones have higher margins, but can be costly to put in place and to operate. The trick is to find the right balance between the different types of Channels, to integrate them in a way to create a great customer experience, and to maximize revenues.

## 4. Customer Relationships (CR) 
The Customer Relationships Building Block describes the types of relationships a company establishes with specific Customer Segments
Example: In the early days, mobile network operators focused on acquiring new customers. They offered incentives like free mobile phones to attract as many users as possible. This aggressive acquisition strategy led to rapid market growth. As the market became saturated, it became more difficult to attract new customers. Operators realized that retaining existing customers was more profitable. They shifted their focus to customer retention and increasing average revenue per customer (ARPU). This meant offering additional services, like data plans or premium content, to encourage customers to spend more. The type of customer relationship a company cultivates depends on its business model. For example, a company that relies on recurring revenue (like a subscription service) will focus on building long-term relationships with customers. On the other hand, a company that sells one-time products may prioritize customer satisfaction but not necessarily long-term loyalty.

## 5. Revenue Streams (R$)
Revenue streams result from value propositions successfully offered to customers.
If customers comprise the heart of a business model, Revenue Streams are its arteries. A company must ask itself, For what value is each Customer Segment truly willing to pay? Successfully answering that question allows the firm to generate one or more Revenue Streams from each Customer Segment. Each Revenue Stream may have different pricing mechanisms, such as fixed list prices, bargaining, auctioning, market dependent, volume dependent, or yield management.
A business model can involve two different types of Revenue Streams: 1. Transaction revenues resulting from one-time customer payments 2. Recurring revenues resulting from ongoing payments to either deliver a Value Proposition to customers or provide post-purchase customer support

### There are several ways to generate Revenue Streams:
#### Asset sale :
The most widely understood Revenue Stream derives from selling ownership rights to a physical product. Amazon.com sells books, music, consumer electron ics, and more online. Fiat sells automobiles, which buyers are free to drive, resell, or even destroy.
#### Usage fee:
This Revenue Stream is generated by the use of a particular service. The more a service is used, the more the customer pays.
#### Subscription fees: 
This Revenue Stream is generated by selling continu ous access to a service. A gym sells its members monthly or yearly subscriptions in exchange for access to its exercise facilities.
#### Licensing:
This Revenue Stream is generated by giving customers permission to use protected intellectual property in exchange for licensing fees. Licensing allows rights holders to generate revenues from their property with out having to manufacture a product or commercialize a service. Licensing is common in the media industry, where content owners retain copyright while selling usage licenses to third parties. Similarly, in technology sectors, patentholders grant other companies the right to use a patented technology in return for a license fee.
#### Brokerage fees:
This Revenue Stream derives from intermediation services performed on behalf of two or more parties.
#### Advertising:
This Revenue Stream results from fees for advertising a particular product, service, or brand. Traditionally, the media industry and event organizers relied heavily on revenues from advertising. In recent years other sectors, including software and services, have started relying more heavily on advertising revenues.

### pricing mechanisms:
Each Revenue Stream might have different pricing mechanisms.
There are two main types of pricing mechanism: fixed and dynamic pricing.
#### Fixed Menu Pricing
 where predefined prices are based on static variables, they could be: 
 * List price: Fixed prices for individual products, services, or other Value Propositions
 * Product feature dependent: Price depends on the number or quality of Value Proposition features
 * Customer segment dependent: Price depends on the type and characteristic of a Customer Segment
 * Volume dependent: Price as a function of the quantity purchased
#### Dynamic Pricing
Prices change based on market conditions. (not our case)

	In our case, its a fixed pricing. Most likely Product feature dependent.

## 6. Key Resources (KR)
Key resources are the assets required to offer and deliver the previously described elements . . .
The Key Resources Building Block describes the most important assets required to make a business model work Every business model requires Key Resources. These resources allow an enterprise to create and oΩer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain relationships with Customer Segments, and earn revenues. DiΩerent Key Resources are needed depending on the type of business model. A microchip manufacturer requires capital-intensive production facilities, whereas a microchip designer focuses more on human resources. Key resources can be physical, fi nancial, intellectual, or human. Key resources can be owned or leased by the company or acquired from key partners.

Key Resources can be categorized as follows:
Physical, Human, Intellectual, Financial 

	- [ ]  Need to understand how this relates to our case
## 7. Key Activities (KA)
. . . by performing a number of Key Activities.
The Key Activities Building Block describes the most important things a company must do to make its business model work Every business model calls for a number of Key Activities.
These are the most important actions a company must take to operate successfully.
Like Key Resources, they are required to create and offer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain Customer Relationships, and earn revenues.
And like Key Resources, Key Activities differ depending on business model type.

Key Activities can be categorized as follows:
### Production
These activities relate to designing, making, and delivering a product in substantial quantities and/or of superior quality. Production activity dominates the business models of manufacturing firms.
### Problem solving
Key Activities of this type relate to coming up with new solutions to individual customer problems. The operations of consultancies, hospitals, and other service organizations are typically dominated by problem solving activities. Their business models call for activities such as knowledge management and continuous training.
### Platform/network
Business models designed with a platform as a Key Resource are dominated by platform or network related Key Activities. Networks, matchmaking platforms, software, and even brands can function as a platform. eBay’s business model requires that the company continually develop and maintain its plat form: the Web site at eBay.com. Visa’s business model requires activities related to its Visa® credit card transaction platform for merchants, customers, and banks. Microsoft’s business model requires managing the interface between other vendors’ software and its Windows® operating system platform. Key Activities in this category relate to platform management, service provisioning, and platform promotion

	Our case falls under problem solving, 
	- [ ] We need to understand more the "platform/network" category bc maybe it falls under it too

**For software maker Microsoft, Key Activities include software development. For PC manufacturer Dell, Key Activities include supply chain management. *For consultancy McKinsey, Key Activities include problem solving.***
## 8. Key Partnerships (KP)

Some activities are outsourced and some resources are acquired outside the enterprise.
Companies forge partnerships for many reasons, and partnerships are becoming a cornerstone of many business models. Companies create alliances to optimize their business models, reduce risk, or acquire resources. We can distinguish between four different types of partnerships: 1. Strategic alliances between non-competitors 2. Coopetition: strategic partnerships between competitors 3. Joint ventures to develop new businesses 4. Buyer-supplier relationships to assure reliable supplies

The reasons for a partnership could be:
### Optimization and economy of scale
buyer-supplier relationship is designed to optimize the allocation of resources and activities. It is illogical for a company to own all resources or perform every activity by itself. Optimization and economy of scale partnerships are usually formed to reduce costs, and often involve outsourcing or sharing infrastructure.
### Reduction of risk and uncertainty
Partnership with competitors
### Acquisition of particular resources and activities
Few companies own all the resources or perform all the activities described by their business models. Rather, ==they extend their own capabilities by relying on other firms to furnish particular resources or perform certain activities.== Such partnerships can be motivated by needs to acquire knowledge, licenses, or access to customers. ==A mobile phone manufacturer, for example, may license an operating system for its handsets rather than developing one in-house.== An insurer may choose to rely on independent brokers to sell its policies rather than develop its own sales force.

	In our case, we have Hosting services as a sort of a partner or a supplier, because they host the websites that we create for our clients. and maybe Facebook ads, wordpress, Bricks builder too!
	It falls under "Acquisition of particular resources and activities"

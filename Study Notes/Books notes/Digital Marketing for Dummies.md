# Chapter 1 : Understanding the Customer Journey
- Think about the last important purchase you made, bought a car, hired a babysitter, or switched coffee suppliers at your office. Chances are, you consulted the Internet to read reviews, get recommendations from friends and family on social sites like Facebook, and boned up on the features, options, and price of the product or service before you made your choice. 
- Regardless of what you sell, an online presence is necessary to capitalize on this trend, 
- Savvy companies use the Internet to drive awareness and interest in what they offer, but also to ==convert casual buyers into brand advocates== who buy more and encourage members of their network to do the same.
- nothing in marketing has changed. Marketing is still about developing a ==mutually beneficial relationship with prospects, leads, and customers==. We call the development of this relationship the ==customer journey.==
- ==The role of your digital marketing is to assist in moving a prospect, lead, or customer from one stage of the customer journey to the next.==
## Creating a Customer Avatar
You must first attain clarity on the characteristics of your ideal customers. You want to get clear on their goals, the challenges they face meeting those goals, and where they spend time consuming information and entertainment. Creating a customer avatar will give you this clarity. ==Other terms for customer avatar are buyer persona, marketing persona, and target audience, but customer avatar is the term we use throughout this book.==

A customer avatar is the fictional, generalized representation of your ideal customer. Realistically, unless your product or service fits within a narrow niche, ==you will have multiple customer avatars for each campaign==. People are so much more than their age, gender, ethnicity, religious background, profession, and so on. People don’t fit neatly into boxes, which is why ==broad, generic marketing campaigns generally don’t convert well; ==they don’t resonate with your audience. It is absolutely crucial that you understand and make your customer avatar as specific as possible so that you can craft personalized content, offers, and marketing campaigns that interest members of your audience or solve their problems. ==Any part of the marketing and sales process that touches the customer (which is pretty much everything) improves when you get clear on your customer avatar.==
### What to include in your customer avatar
The customer avatar possesses five major components: 
- Goals and values: Determine what the avatar is trying to achieve. What values does he or she hold dear? 
- Sources of information: Figure out what books, magazines, blogs, news stations, and other resources the avatar references for information. 
- Demographics: Establish the age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, income, employment status, nationality, and political preference of the avatar. 
- Challenges and pain points: What is holding the avatar back from achieving his or her goals? 
- Objections: Why would the avatar choose not to buy your product or service?

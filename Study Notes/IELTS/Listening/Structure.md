**Duration :** 30min + 10min for transferring answers.

Consists of 4 Parts, the difficulty increases gradually.
==You must spend more time preparing for part 3 and 4== as they separate the low bands from the high bands.

The listening test is the same in the general purpose and academic IELTS test.

==Your job is to find the correct answers. You don't have to understand every word to answer correctly, especially for part 3 and 4.==
# Part 1
- A general/social setting conversation (between two or more people) 
- Generally between two persons
- Generally a phone call
- Form filling/taking down information (phone numbers, address, license plate number...)
# Part 2
- a general/social setting monologue (one person)
# Part 3
- an educational/training setting conversation between up to 4 people. (e.g. A teacher discussing an assignment)
# Part 4
- an educational/training setting monologue (e.g. A university lecture)
# General Strategy

- Read the questions and prepare for the answers before the recording. For each part, you will have time to do this.
	- Lock on the required word count![[Pasted image 20251101110049.png]]
	- Know the type of the question and the type of the answer needed and how many words are permitted before listening
	- Read the title to get a general idea about the listening and be mentally prepared for the topic.
	- Read the subheadings to section the passage and to navigate through answers
	- Predict the type of answers by reading the text around the blanks.
	- Predict the possible answers by reading the text around the blanks.

- Focus on the current question that you are trying to answer and keep in the side of your brain the next question to use it as a flag that signals the end of the current question and the beginning of the next one.
	- It's like having peripheral awareness when listening to be more precise and efficient while answering.

- Always keep moving. Don't freeze when you are confused or have missed something.
- Always give an answer. If you don't know the answer, don't leave it blank.
	- You can use the strategy of elimination if it's a choice answer.

# Common traps and challenges
- **Changing the answer:** The answer to a question could be changed later in the course of the recording as a correction for example.
- **The employment of synonyms:** if you expect that the words that you listen to will be identical to the ones surrounding the answer, then you will be lost most of the time. you have to keep you mind open to synonyms. 
- **Giving incomplete answers**: You have to provide complete answers in filling the blanks type answers. Don't ignore adjectives (detachable, remote...), uncertainty words (about, around...)
- **Unusual spellings:** surnames or places for example. E.g. Brown => Browne. this usually comes in part 1 and the name will be spelled so you must pay attention to how they spell it.
- **Double negatives:** E.g. not bad = good, not unusual = usual...
  The food wasn't bad = the food was good
- **Using fake tests:** only use tests from these 4 free sources: IDP, british council, IELTS.org, Cambridge English.

# Types of questions
There are many different types of questions. Each type of question tests your one or more of your listening skills.
Each type of question requires a strategy to answer it. Don't use a universal strategy to answer all types of questions 

- Summary Completion 
- Form filling
- Multiple choice question 
- Labeling a map or plan

# Strategy by type of question
## Map/plan

1. Before the start of the recording
	1. Understand what is the assignment (write text, write letters...)
	2. Understand the map/plan features
	3. Predict where the start of the map/plan might be (gate, entrance...)
	4. Predict answers by intuition
	5. Understand the relationships between locations (next to each other, opposing each other...)
	6. Write down synonyms for answers (gate = entrance = door...)
2. On the recording
	1. Listen to the beginning of the talk very carefully
	2. Find the initial position and the direction
	3. Visualize walking though the map/plan
	4. Be careful to the traps (e.g. : to the left there was the café but it was moved to the left...)
	5. Identify signposting language (e.g.: lets start off the sought gate, take the left of the glass house, go back, finish off on the north gate...)

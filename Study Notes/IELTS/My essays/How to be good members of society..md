People have different opinions regarding the best way of teaching children how to be good members of society. Some believe that parents are the best candidates for this responsibility, while others think that school is better suited for to fulfill this role. Although parents have a big influence on their children, and their children tend to imitate them in their behavior and personality, I believe that school is the best candidate to fulfill this role.

Children spend most of their early years with their parents and eventually learn from them subconsiously, this results in the likeliness of the imitation of their parents' behaviour and mentality in their developement phase. For example we can find many children around us who talk like their parents and use the same vocabulary. Inspite of these conditions that could help parents be fit to delivering good society values to their children, I believe that school is more qualified and systematized in performing this task.

School's methods of teching are based on scientific research and ==utilizes== effective and well tested techniques that ensures the delivery of the right ideas to children, for example organising voluntary activities for them, showing them the impact of public service and charity on society with real cases. In addition, teachers are highly trained and are constantly updated with the newest techniques of teaching, like using psychology in their methods.

In conclusion, although parents play a great role in teaching their children how to be better citizens, I believe that school is better suited for this responsibility.

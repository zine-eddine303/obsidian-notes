## Common Problems

1. [Synonyms and paraphrasing](https://www.ieltsadvantage.com/2015/03/31/paraphrase-ielts/). Students who are unaware of these tend to look for keywords in the text that directly match those in the questions. This wastes lots of time and good time management is essential in the reading test.
2. Word limit can also cause people to throw away easy marks. If you write over the stated word limit you will get the answer wrong.
3. You don’t have to read every word of the text. These questions test your ability to skim and scan for specific information. You also won’t have time to read every word.
4. Students often see a word they don’t understand in the question or text and either panic or spend too much time thinking about the meaning.
5. Some students try to write full sentences. Your answers don’t have to be grammatically correct so stay under the word limit.

## Tips

1. The answers appear in the same order as the text.
2. Look at and understand the questions first before you start reading the text. What is the question actually asking?
3. You will probably be given a word limit, for example **‘NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER.’** Make sure you don’t go over this limit.
4. As stated above, the answers do not need to be grammatically correct, just short answers.
5. Keywords in the question will normally be nouns or noun phrases.
6. When you find your keywords always think synonyms and paraphrases.

## Strategy

1. Read the instructions carefully and note the word limit.
2. Read and understand the questions. Think about the information you will need to find.
3. Underline any keywords in the questions.
4. Think about synonyms or paraphrases for these keywords.
5. Find the part of the text that the question relates to.
6. Read question again.
7. Read the section containing the answer **carefully** and identify answer.
8. Continue with next question and repeat until finished.

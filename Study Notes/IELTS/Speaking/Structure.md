Made of 3 different parts, each part had different questions and different answers.
You should treat each part separately.

## Don't worry about:

- Body language
- Hand gestures
- Clothing
- Eye contact
- Greeting
- The examiner

## Worry about

- Pronounciation
- Vocuabulary
- Fluency and cohernece
- Grammar

# Part 1
This part is ABOUT YOU, The examiner will ask you familiar, everyday questions about your life. This will last around 4-5 minutes. See the links below for tips, sample questions and answers for Part 1.

# Common answer mistakes

- Too long (don't give too much info especially if you go out of the question's scope)
- Too short (just answer the question and provide some extra detail)
	- Example: *What do you do in your life?* 
	  ❌ I'm a web designer. 
	  ✅ I design websites and develop them for clients as a freelancer. 
	  ✅ I'm a web designer, I create websites and develop them for business owners 
- Trying to impress the examiner
- Robotic delivery
- Memorize questions and answers (the examiners are trained to spot those)

## Best practices

- Be natural
- Elaborate (give examples and general details)
- Coherence (answer the actual question that you've been asked)
- Be specific when you are asked about a specific thing, don't give general answers for them

# How to answer

Answer > Explain > Example (not for all types of questions, only where it is relevant to give an example)







# Part 2
Part 2 is sometimes called the ‘long turn’. You will be given a cue card, and you will have 1 minute to prepare your answer. You will then be asked to speak for 1 to 2 minutes.

# Part 3 
Part 3 is more abstract. This is your opportunity to really develop your answers and discuss the issues brought up by the examiner. ==The topic will be linked to the topic you discussed in Part 2==, which will last 4-5 minutes.

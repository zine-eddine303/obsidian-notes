Made of 3 different parts, each part had different questions and different answers.
You should treat each part separately.

## Don't worry about:

- Body language
- Hand gestures
- Clothing
- Eye contact
- Greeting
- The examiner

## Worry about

- Pronounciation
- Vocuabulary
- Fluency and cohernece
- Grammar

# Part 1
This part is ABOUT YOU, The examiner will ask you familiar, everyday questions about your life. This will last around 4-5 minutes. See the links below for tips, sample questions and answers for Part 1.

# Common answer mistakes

- Too long (don't give too much info especially if you go out of the question's scope)
- Too short (just answer the question and provide some extra detail)
	- Example: *What do you do in your life?* 
	  ❌ I'm a web designer. 
	  ✅ I design websites and develop them for clients as a freelancer. 
	  ✅ I'm a web designer, I create websites and develop them for business owners 
- Trying to impress the examiner
- Robotic delivery
- Memorize questions and answers (the examiners are trained to spot those)

## Best practices

- Be natural
- Elaborate (give examples and general details)
- Coherence (answer the actual question that you've been asked)
- Be specific when you are asked about a specific thing, don't give general answers for them

# How to answer

Answer > Explain > Example (not for all types of questions, only where it is relevant to give an example)

# Part 2

Part 2 is sometimes called the ‘long turn’. You will be given a cue card, and you will have 1 minute to prepare your answer. You will then be asked to speak for 1 to 2 minutes.
 
## what is the goal?
- Speak fluently and coherently for up to 2 minutes about the topic
	- Fluently: doesnt mean that you shouldn't stop or pause, it means that you should speak naturally and you can make natural pasues (to formulate ideas).
	  Dont make unnatural pauses (pauses to think about grammar and verbs and such)
	- Coherently; stick to the topic 
- The examiner should understand what you're saying (pronounciation, grammar, vocabulary)
## Common problems

1. Unable to speak for 2 mins
	- Lack of development: you should speak in detail about each bullet point, you have 2 minustes and you have to talk through them
# Part 3 
Part 3 is more abstract. This is your opportunity to really develop your answers and discuss the issues brought up by the examiner. ==The topic will be linked to the topic you discussed in Part 2==, which will last 4-5 minutes.

	1. Did you answer the question?
	2. Were you fluent? Umms and ahhs

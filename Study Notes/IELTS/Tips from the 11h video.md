# Writing  
## Task 2 [[IELTS Structure#3. **Writing**]]
### Don'ts  
1. Don't just read sample essays and expect to get better  
2. Don't read fake sample essays  
3. Don't try to evaluate the sample essays and compare yourself with them, you dont have an examiner's level to do so  
### Do's  
1. Get a sample essay from [sample writing essays.docx](E:\ELT\IELTS\sample-writing-essays.docx)  and cover the essay and only read the question, and think in your head "what is the simplest idea that answers this question ? If i asked a 100 person this question, which answer would be the most popular?" And write them down, then look at the ideas that the essay proposes and compare them with yours. If they are similar it means that you're in the right path. if their different, it doesn't mean that you're wrong, maybe your ideas are also relevant, so check if they are actually relevant or not, if they are not it means that you haven't understood the question  
2. After seeing the ideas proposed in the sample essay, pick one and develop the idea into a body, and then compare it with the sample, and do the same evaluation as before. ==Do this to every idea, and every essay on the same question==.  
3. Study the structure of the essays. For example if we have a question like this: some people believe that (idea 1) while others think that (idea 2), discuss both views and give your opinion. 
4. Look for "linking words" or "cohesive devices" in the essays, like: for example, in other words, for instance, in conclusion... Dont over use them, only use a few (like 4 ones in the essay). And learn why the students used a specific linking word in that specific case, learn the correct use of each word
5. Analyze grammatical structures and tenses used in the samples
6. Broaden the vocabulary by reading the questions and the sample essays and identifying unknown vocabulary and add them to your dictionary
7. Once you reinforce your weaknesses (by doing the tasks above), write your own essay and compare it to the sample. compare the structure,  and not the answer  
## How to write a task 2 essay
We are going to treat **double questions** only, a lot of the things that we are going to do are doable for tall the other types of questions.
Example: 

	Nowadays more task at home and work are being performed by robots.
	Why do you think this is happening?
	Is it a positive or negative developement?
### Double question essay structure
1. Introduction: introduce the topic: Nowadays more task at home and work are being performed by robots.
2. Main body 1: answer 1st question: I think it is happening because
3. Main body 2: answer 2st question: I believe that is is a positive/negative
4. Conclusion: summarize the above
### How to analyse a question?
1. Find the topic: like here its technology
2. Find the keywords: here its: robots working for humans.
3. Understand the instruction: what does the examiner want you to do? like here he wants us to give our opinion
### How to decide the answer?
1. You have to think about your answer before you start writing 
2. ==Writing is a reflection of your thinking==, if your thinking is complicated, your answer is going to be complicated
3. ==Keep it simple==, the simplest most straightforward answer is the best answer 
4. Write about the things that you can write about (the things that you have a bit of knowledge on them)
6. If you are asked something like this example: "Is it a positive or negative developement?", ==chose anyone of them== and go with them, pick the easiest one.
### How to generate ideas?
1. You already primed your brain to think of ideas in a logical way that will lead to clear ideas
2.  The most obvious ideas are the best ones
3. There's no extra mark for 'amazing' ideas, what matters is: 
	-  Are your ideas relevant to the question (which reflects the degree of understanding of the question)
	-  How well do you develop the ideas
	-  Is your language correct...
4. ==Ask yourself direct, specific questions about the question==, this will generate specific and relevant ideas in a short amount of time
5. ==The first ideas you think of are nomally the best==
Example of direct questions that you should ask: Is it a positive developement? => why is it a positive developement?
### Demo 
Nowadays more ==tasks== at ==home and work== are being performed by ==robots==.
Why do you think this is happening? *Because of the technological advancement*
Is it a positive or negative developement? *Negative because it lays of a lot of people from their jobs / Positive because it reduces the amount of work that we have to do.*
### What is an introduction?
- Tells the reader what to expect. ALWAYS THINK OF THE READER
- Helps the reader follow the rest of your essay
- Helps you get your thoughts in order. Like a mini plan that wil help you write a better essay
### What IS NOT an introduction?
- IT IS NOT a chance to show the examiner how amazing your language is, if you make a vocalbulary or gramatical mistake, it's a bad start and the examiner will judge you badly. ==Keep it as simple as possible.==
- IT IS NOT A CHANCE to hook the reader 
### Structure of DOUBLE QUESTION introduction
*This is only applicable to this type of task 2 questions*
1. **Paraphrase the question statement (this is th question statement => "Nowadays more task at home and work are being performed by robots")**: 
   State the same ideas using different words, you can do this using synonims and/or change the structure of the sentence
2. **Briefly answer answer each question**: Use the **2 ideas** that you generated in the demo and turn them into a sentence, like this for example: *This is due to advancements in technology and it should be seen as a positive developement because it reduces a person's workload*
3. **Put it all together**: example: *Robotics increasingly play a role both in the home and the workplace. This is due to advancements in technology and it should be seen as a positive developement because it reduces a person's workload* 
4. ==**Don't list many ideas:**== the ideas that you mention in the intoductions must match with the ideas that are in the body, you cant list 3 or 4 ideas in the intorduction and talk about only two of them in the body, preferably pick only 1 idea per answer.

# Writing  
## Task 2 [[IELTS Structure#3. **Writing**]]
### Don'ts  
1. Don't just read sample essays and expect to get better  
2. Don't read fake sample essays  
3. Don't try to evaluate the sample essays and compare yourself with them, you dont have an examiner's level to do so  
### Do's  
1. Get a sample essay from [sample writing essays.docx](E:\ELT\IELTS\sample-writing-essays.docx)  and cover the essay and only read the question, and think in your head "what is the simplest idea that answers this question ? If i asked a 100 person this question, which answer would be the most popular?" And write them down, then look at the ideas that the essay proposes and compare them with yours. If they are similar it means that you're in the right path. if their different, it doesn't mean that you're wrong, maybe your ideas are also relevant, so check if they are actually relevant or not, if they are not it means that you haven't understood the question  
2. After seeing the ideas proposed in the sample essay, pick one and develop the idea into a body, and then compare it with the sample, and do the same evaluation as before. ==Do this to every idea, and every essay on the same question==.  
3. Study the structure of the essays. For example if we have a question like this: some people believe that (idea 1) while others think that (idea 2), discuss both views and give your opinion. 
4. Look for "linking words" or "cohesive devices" in the essays, like: for example, in other words, for instance, in conclusion... Dont over use them, only use a few (like 4 ones in the essay). And learn why the students used a specific linking word in that specific case, learn the correct use of each word
5. Analyze grammatical structures and tenses used in the samples
6. Broaden the vocabulary by reading the questions and the sample essays and identifying unknown vocabulary and add them to your dictionary
7. Once you reinforce your weaknesses (by doing the tasks above), write your own essay and compare it to the sample. compare the structure,  and not the answer  

## How to write a task 2 essay
We are going to treat **double questions** only, a lot of the things that we are going to do are doable for tall the other types of questions.
Example: 

	Nowadays more task at home and work are being performed by robots.
	Why do you think this is happening?
	Is it a positive or negative developement?

## How to analyse a question?
1. Find the topic: like here its technology
2. Find the keywords: here its: robots working for humans.
3. Understand the instruction: what does the examiner want you to do? like here he wants us to give our opinion
## How to decide the answer?
1. You have to think about your answer before you start writing 
2. ==Writing is a reflection of your thinking==, if your thinking is complicated, your answer is going to be complicated
3. Keep it simple, the simplest most straightforward answer is the best answer 
4. Write about the things that you can write about (the things that you have a bit of knowledge on them)
5. If you are asked something like this example: Is it a positive or negative developement?

### How to write introductions?

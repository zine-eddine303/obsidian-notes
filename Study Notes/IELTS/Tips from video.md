# Writing  
## Don'ts  
1. Don't just read sample essays and expect to get better  
2. Don't read fake sample essays  
3. Don't try to evaluate the sample essays and compare yourself with them, you dont have an examiner's level to do so  
# Dos  
1. Get a sample essay from [sample writing essays.docx](E:\ELT\IELTS\sample-writing-essays.docx)  and cover the essay and only read the question, and think in your head "what is the simplest idea that answers this question ? If i asked a 100 person this question, which answer would be the most popular?" And write them down, then look at the ideas that the essay proposes and compare them with yours. If they are similar it means that you're in the right path. if their different, it doesn't mean that you're wrong, maybe your ideas are also relevant, so check if they are actually relevant or not, if they are not it means that you haven't understood the question  
2. After seeing the ideas proposed in the sample essay, pick one and develop the idea into a body, and then compare it with the sample, and do the same evaluation as before. ==Do this to every idea, and every essay on the same question==.  
3. [x] Study the structure of the essays. For example if we have a question like this: some people believe that (idea 1) while others think that (idea 2), discuss both views and give your opinion. 
4. [x] Look for "linking words" or "cohesive devices" in the essays, like: for example, in other words, for instance, in conclusion... Dont over use them, only use a few (like 4 ones in the essay). And learn why the students used a specific linking word in that specific case, learn the correct use of each word
5. Analyze grammatical structures and tenses used in the samples
6. Broaden the vocabulary by reading the questions and the sample essays and identifying unknown vocabulary and add them to your dictionary
7. Once you reinforce your weaknesses (by doing the tasks above), write your own essay and compare it to the sample. compare the structure,  and not the answer

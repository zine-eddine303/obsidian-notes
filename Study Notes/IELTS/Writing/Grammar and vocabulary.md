## Comma ,

### Don'ts

- You can't use a comma to replace a full stop in order to create a longer complex sentence
- You can't use a comma after a Linking word/Cohesive device that is in the middle of the sentence. If you want to do so, use a semicolon before the linking word and then put the comma after the linking word
	- example: ...... ; however, .....

### Do's

- Use it between a list of items
	- example: I bought a coat, a hat and a shirt when I was at the mall

-  Use after Linking words/Cohesive devices that are in the begining of the sentence
	- **In conclusion**, I believe that ....
	- is going. **In addition**, we have the...

- Use after an introductory adverb (unfortunately, accordingly, basically)

- Use before conjunctions (and, but, for, or, not, so, yet) to link up two **independent clauses**
	- (independent clause) > ==We felt tiered== **, so** ==we went to bed earlier== < (independent clause)
	- (independent clause) > There was heavy traffic **, and** the weather was getting hot < (independent clause)
	- CAUTION: then is not a conjunction. You should use a conjunction before it 
		- ❌ We stopped a taxi, **then** we went to the party.
		- ✅ We stopped a taxi, **and then** we went to the party.

- Use before extra information in the sentence,  extra information is a part in the sentence that if you remove, the meaning of the sentence wont change
	- The new bag~~, which I bought yeaterday,~~ is extremely expensive in this city

- Use after a **dependent clause** when they start a sentence. If the sentence started with an independent clause, then you dont need a comma at all
	- (dependent clause) > Although I was in the shopping center, I didn't buy the coat < (independent clause)
	- I didnt buy the coat although I was in the shopping center (it started with an independent clause)

- Use between 2 or more adjectives that describe the same noun

# Double letters

Struggling with double letters in words is a common issue, especially when they change forms, like from verbs to adjectives or adverbs. While English has many exceptions, there are some general rules that can help:

### 1. **Doubling the final consonant (especially for adjectives and adverbs)**

- When a word ends with a single vowel followed by a single consonant, and the final syllable is stressed, the final consonant is often doubled when adding a suffix (-ing, -ed, -er, -est, -ly).
    - Examples:
        - **Big** → **Bigger**
        - **Thin** → **Thinner**
        - **Run** → **Running**
        - **Fit** → **Fittest**
- However, if the stress is not on the final syllable, the consonant usually isn’t doubled.
    - Example: **Visit** → **Visiting** (no doubling because the stress is on the first syllable).

### 2. **Words ending in L (UK vs US spelling)**

- In British English, words that end in L tend to double the L when adding suffixes like -ed or -ing. In American English, this is not always the case.
    - UK: **Travel** → **Travelled**, **Travelling**
    - US: **Travel** → **Traveled**, **Traveling**
- When making an adverb from adjectives ending in “l,” you typically don’t need to add extra letters unless it ends with a double l.
    - Example: **Final** → **Finally**

### 3. **Words ending in silent E**

- If a word ends with a silent e, you typically drop the e before adding a suffix starting with a vowel (e.g., -ing, -ed) but keep the e before suffixes starting with consonants (e.g., -ly, -ness).
    - **Adore** → **Adoring**
    - **Hope** → **Hoping**
    - **Late** → **Lately**

### 4. **Words ending in Y**

- If a word ends in “y” preceded by a consonant, the y usually changes to i when adding suffixes like -ed, -es, or -er. However, before adding -ing, the y stays the same.
    - **Happy** → **Happier**
    - **Cry** → **Cried**
    - **Cry** → **Crying** (no change)

### 5. **Common Irregularities**

- Some words just need to be memorized as exceptions (e.g., **Benefit** → **Benefited** without doubling, but **Fit** → **Fitted** with doubling).

### 6. **Use the Base Word as a Guide**

- If the base word has double letters, then it will keep those in the new form:
    - **Full** → **Fully**
    - **Skill** → **Skilled**

Practicing with these rules in mind will help you develop a better instinct for when double letters appear. And of course, reading and exposure to more texts will reinforce them!

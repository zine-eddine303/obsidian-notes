# Grammar

- **Inhabitable** and **habitable** are synonyms, the opposite is **uninhabitable**
- **Short form :** Avoid using short forms because you are not doing it consistently. It's => it is, don't => do not
- **Despite of** : you can't say despite of, either use despite only, or use in spite of
- **Capitalized words :** Always mind the capital letters of nouns
- **z or s at the end of a word**: practice how to know how to use them (like colonize, localize...) 
- **While**...... , ~~but~~ **I believe** ...
- ==Need to learn how to link ideas more fluently==
- Practice more articles
- ==If you only eliminate very minor and stupid mistakes, you can improve your ban significantly by 1 or 1.5==
- Understand the difference between **[[Opinion essays]]** and **[[Discussion essays]]**
- ==Need to be more detailed in Task 1.==

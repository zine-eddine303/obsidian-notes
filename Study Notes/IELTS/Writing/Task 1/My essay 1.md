# My essay 

The graph illustrates the recycling rate of some materials in a country between 1982 and 2010.

Overall, The recycling percentage of paper, cardboard and glass containers fluctuates throughout the years. On the other hand, the recycling of aluminium cans and plastic have increased, ==a significant and a slight increase for aluminium cans and plastic respectively.==

==Paper and cardboard are the most recycled materials in this country==. The rate of recycling of these materials was 70% and below from 1982 to 1990. This trend went into a peak and reached 80% in 1994, and then started declining back to 70% till 2010.

Recycling of glass containers went from 50% in 1982 to 40% in 1990, and then it started increasing to reach 60% by the year 2010.

In contrast, aluminium cans recycling has been rapidly and constantly increasing from 1986 to 2010, starting from around 5% to approximately 45%

Finally, plastic recycling have went though a slow increase of less than 10% from 1990 to 2010



# Sample answer

The ==chart== shows the ==percentages== of paper and cardboard, glass containers, aluminium cans and plastics that were recycled in one country ==between== 1982 and 2010.

In 1982, about 65% of paper and cardboard was recycled. This figure ==fluctuated== before rising steeply to reach a ==peak== of 80% in 1994. From then on, however, it decreased ==steadily== ==to a level== of 70% in 2010. In 1982, ==half== of all glass containers were recycled; after ==dipping== to a low of 40% in 1990, the glass recycling rate ==gradually== increased to 60% ==by 2010==.

Aluminium cans were ==first== recycled in 1986, starting at about 5%, but this figure ==climbed== ==rapidly== ==over 25 years ==and ==by 2010 it had reached== 45%. Recycling of plastics, ==on the other hand==, was not introduced ==until== 1990 and, ==although the growth== in this category was also ==constant==, it was very ==slow==, rising from about 2% to around 8% ==over the period.==

Overall, the ==proportion== of paper and cardboard that was recycled was the highest of the four ==classes of material==, but this category experienced a decline after 1994, ==whereas== there was a ==continuing upward trend== in the recycling of the other materials.

## Critic
- **"have increased"**: In the second sentence of the introduction, "the recycling of aluminium cans and plastic **have** increased" should be "has increased" because "recycling" is singular.
	- **Corrected**: "the recycling of aluminium cans and plastic has increased..."

- "**went into a peak"**: This expression is incorrect. It should be "reached a peak."
	- **Corrected**: "This trend reached a peak of 80% in 1994..."

- **"started declining back to 70% till 2010"**: "Till" is informal. Use "until" in formal writing. Also, "declining back" is repetitive. It should just be "declining to 70%."
	- **Corrected**: "and then started declining to 70% until 2010."

- **aluminium cans recycling"**: This is awkward phrasing. It should be "the recycling of aluminium cans."
	- **Corrected**: "The recycling of aluminium cans has been rapidly and constantly increasing..."

**"have went"**: This is incorrect. The correct form is "has gone."
	- **Corrected**: "Plastic recycling has gone through a slow increase of less than 10% from 1990 to 2010."


# My improved essay

The ==chart== illustrates the recycling rate of paper and cardboard, glass containers, Aluminium casn and plastic in a country between 1982 and 2010.

From 1982 to 1990, the recycling of paper and cardboard fluctuated between 65% and 70% before reaching a peak and  reached 80% in 1994. From then on, however, it steadility declined back to 70% in 2010. In 1982, half of glass containers were recycled. After dipping to 40% by 1990, it started increasing constantly to reach 60% by 2010.

Aluminium cans recycling has been rapidly and constantly increasing from 5% in 1986 when it was first recycled, to 45% in 2010. In contrast, plastic recycling have went though a slow increase of less than 10% from 1990, the first year plastic was recycled, to 2010.

Overall, the propostion of paper and cardboard that was recycled was higher than the other material classes, but it started continually decreasing since 1994. On the other hand, recycling of the other materials have steadily increased throughout hte years.

The fisrt map illustrates the layout of Lynwich college in 2006 and the other one shows how it is now.

Overall, it is noticable that there are now fewer green spaces and more buildngs and paths in comparison with how the establishment was in 2006; in addition, now new buildings have been contructed for lectures and lessons.

A new cafeteria was buit at the center with multiple paths leading to it, making it accessible from almost any building in the college. In addition to the original sports field, a new sports centre was built next to it.

In the past, college was only accessible by car; conversly, it is now accessible by bus and a new bike storage was added next to the original car park. A cluster of trees was cut down on the southeastern side of the institution for the relocation of the library which got significantly expanded, and is now accessible from both college buildings one and two.

This is a strong Task 1 response! You have correctly identified the major transformations, such as the addition of the cafeteria and the shift in transport accessibility.

Based on the criteria for **Writing Task 1**, I would grade this essay as a **6.5 - 7.0**.

|**Category**|**Score**|**Observations**|
|---|---|---|
|**Task Achievement**|**7.0**|You covered all major changes: the library relocation, the new sports center, the cafeteria, and transport changes.|
|**Coherence & Cohesion**|**7.0**|Good use of transition words like "Overall," "In addition," and "Conversely." The flow is logical.|
|**Lexical Resource**|**6.5**|You used specific vocabulary like "cluster of trees," "accessible," and "relocation." However, there are several spelling errors.|
|**Grammar**|**6.5**|Your sentence structures are varied, but there are minor errors in word order and pluralization.|
### Essential Corrections

To reach a solid **7.5 or 8.0**, you need to eliminate minor spelling and typing slips.

- **Spelling:** * "fisrt" → **first**
    
    - "buildngs" → **buildings**
        
    - "contructed" → **constructed**
        
    - "buit" → **built**
        
- **Articles & Prepositions:**
    
    - "at the center" → **in the center**
        
    - "next to the original car park" → Note that the car park was actually **reduced in size** to make room for the bike storage.
        
- **Logic Check:**
    
    - In 2006, the college was accessible by the "Road," which usually implies both cars and walking, not "only by car." It is more accurate to say it lacked **public transport facilities**.

### Strategic Feedback: The "Map" Vocabulary

When describing maps, it is very helpful to use **cardinal directions** (North, South, East, West) to be more precise.

> **Example:** "The library, which was originally situated in the **east**, has been moved to the **south-west** corner and connected to both main buildings."

The fisrt map illustrates the layout of Lynwich college in 2006 and the other one shows how it is now.

Overall, it is noticable that there are now fewer green spaces and more buildngs and paths in comparison with how the establishment was in 2006; in addition, now new buildings have been contructed for lectures and lessons.

A new cafeteria was buit at the center with multiple paths leading to it, making it accessible from almost any building in the college. In addition to the original sports field, a new sports centre was built next to it.

In the past, college was only accessible by car; conversly, it is now accessible by bus and a new bike storage was added next to the original car park. A cluster of trees was cut down on the southeastern side of the institution for the relocation of the library which got significantly expanded, and is now accessible from both college buildings one and two.

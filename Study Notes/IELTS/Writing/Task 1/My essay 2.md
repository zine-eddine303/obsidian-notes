The charts show the rate of computer-owning by general population and by population categorized by their level of education, from 2002 to 2010.

Overall, the rate of people owning computers increases constantly throughout the years. In addition, the level of education has a direct relationship with computer ownership.

In 2002, more than half of the general population has a computer, this trend increases steadily to reach almost 80% by 2010.

At least 70% of postgraduates own computers in 2002; while in 2010, almost all of them have computers. 

## Critic
- **"computer-owning"**: The phrase is a bit awkward. It’s better to use "computer ownership."
    
    - **Corrected**: "The charts show the rate of computer ownership by the general population and by population categorized by their level of education, from 2002 to 2010."
- **"has a computer"**: This should be "had a computer" to match the past tense used in the rest of the description.
    
    - **Corrected**: "In 2002, more than half of the general population had a computer..."
- **"Comuters"**: There's a typo here. It should be "computers."
    
    - **Corrected**: "more than half of them own computers in 2002..."
- **"while in 2010"**: The conjunction "while" isn't necessary here. The sentence is clearer without it.
    
    - **Corrected**: "At least 70% of postgraduates owned computers in 2002; in 2010, almost all of them had computers."
- **Other minor improvements**:
    
    - "This trend increases steadily" could be rephrased to "This trend increased steadily" for tense consistency.
    - Consider improving sentence clarity, especially where data changes over time are discussed.


Nowadays==,== people judge eachother's value by relying on materialistic measures. While in the past, they used rational metrics to value a person's worth. They relied on honor, trust and personality. This change could be caused by the change of morals in the current day, our world became more materialistic where money and social position rule everything.

People used to be honest and honorable in the past, if a person didn't adopt these qualities he would be considered an outcast, and a failure to society. However, today all these morals are negliged and replaced by greed, dishonesty and selfishness. Some individuals would do anything for money and power, hoping to climb the ladder of society and become better than everyone else. Indivuals like the latter are praised by society, and considered hard working and successfull despite of the ways they took to reach their goals. For instance, many celebrities are still loved and appreciated despite many evidences proving their awful crimes.

In conclusion, today's society uses different values to measure someone's worth, basing their judgement on wealth and power. Our ancestors used rational values instead, such as honor and honesty. I believe that this change is caused by internal change in society's view of life.

## Critic

1. **"Eachother"**: This should be two words: "each other."
    - **Corrected**: "each other's value."
2. **"Negliged"**: The correct word is "neglected."
    - **Corrected**: "all these morals are neglected and replaced by greed..."
3. **"Indivuals"**: There's a typo here. It should be "individuals."
    - **Corrected**: "Individuals like the latter..."
4. **"Successfull"**: This should be "successful."
    - **Corrected**: "considered hard working and successful..."
5. **"Despite of"**: The correct phrase is "despite" or "in spite of." "Despite of" is incorrect.
    - **Corrected**: "despite the ways they took to reach their goals."
6. **"Evidences"**: "Evidence" is uncountable, so it doesn’t take a plural form.
    - **Corrected**: "despite much evidence proving their awful crimes."

    - **Suggested**: "Individuals motivated by greed and dishonesty are praised by society..."

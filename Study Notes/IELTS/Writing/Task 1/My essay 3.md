# Task 2

## My essay

The internet has revolutionised the way humans communicate with each other, allowing cross continent conversations, and instant access to information through platforms like social media and blogs. There has always been a debate on whethere it's a good or a bad technology for society. While the internet and social media could be used wrongfully, this essay believes that it is a useful tool if we use it responsibly.

Some individuals stand against this developement for security and health concerns. They think that social media cuts real communication between people and keeps them hooked to the digital world. In addition, they believe that it could be used to harm society in many ways: by spreading lies, stealing identities, scamming, hacking and more irresponsible actions. For example, a person used Elon Musk's identity on twitter, and convinced people to send him huge amounts of money as investment, and eventually scammed them and left them with no dime to their names. While the people who are against this technology have understandable concerns; I believe that if we use it cautiously, we can make a lot of advancements by utilising it's advantages.

The internet has solved a lot of problems for our species, for instance it eliminated long distances, information from all around the globe became only one click away. It also provided us with a lot of work oppurtunities. To furthur support this; I for example, have worked with many individuals and companies from the United States and Canada from home. This would have been impossible without a tool like the internet.
If we literate ourselves on how to use the internet and social media safely, and avoid using it excessively, we would eliminate all the threats that it poses on society.

In conclusion, the internet and social media platforms have radically changed communication. Like most other technologies, this one's also a double edged sword, which makes it have positive and negative effects on our lives. I believe that if we regulate and educate ourselves on how to use it safely and responsibly, the world will become a better place.


## Sample essay

Communication styles have changed radically over the past 20 years, and this is largely due to the ==prevalence (1)== of social media websites. Some see this as a wonderful enhancement of their lifestyle, while others have a more ==critical opinion (1)==. This essay will outline the ==benefits and drawbacks (1)== of this phenomenon, and will ==weigh up its merits (1)==.

Social media websites have reached their current level of popularity because of their many advantages. ==Notably (1)==, these websites have made it almost effortless to create and maintain both local and international social networks. In addition, thay allow users to access support when suffering from life’s ==tribulations (1)== and complications. It is possible, as well, to use these sites to find and discuss information about many issues, from the best local shopping to international news. Authorities find social media advantageous when tracking criminals, who sometimes use networks to set up illegal activities. One further advantage is that sites such as ==LinkedIn (2)== are a key resource for job recruiters, and many people find work in this way.

However, these sites also have significant negative consequences. ==Foremost (1)== is the fact that both students and workers can waste a great deal of time and productivity because of the distractions these networks provide. This can adversely affect not only academic life but also career opportunities. Another ==drawback (1)== is the amount of misinformation and ==vicious (1)== rumours that can circulate and ==spread like wildfire (1)==, causing real misery and ==distress (1)== to both private citizens and to celebrities. Finally, the websites tend to reduce time spent on face-to-face communication, and, in my opinion, live family and friend interactions ==are of primary importance (1)== for our mental wellbeing.

In conclusion, although social media sites have the potential to bring people closer together, they encourage time wasting and superficial communication, and the anonymity that they provide allows for unkind, even nasty, social interactions. ==People would do better to spend more quality, face-to-face time with real people. (3)==

## Essay

The bar chart represents the trend of European countries' spending on healthcare as a precentage of gross domestic product for the years 2002, 2007 and 2012.

Overall, the most salient feature is that the variation of the proportion of GDP spent on health for most studied countries was marginal across the three years. It is also obvious that Switzerland - in comparison with the other european countries - had consistently expended the highest proportion of their GDP for every studied year, while Estonia had the lowest figure for the same years.

The proportion of GDP spent on healthcare for Switzerland, Belgium, Spain and Estonia was constant for all three years, with percentage of 11%, 10%, 8% and 3% respectively. Denmark, Norway, Slovenia, Poland and Lithuania each had an unchanged figure on 2002 and 2007, but each had a slight increase of 1% more than their last studied year on 2012. These four countries' figures climbed to 10%, 10%, 9%, 7%, 6% respectively on 2012.

The decrease of proportionate spending to GDP on health over time was found for Luxmebourg and the Netherlands, Luxembourg's figure declined to 7% on 2012 after being on 8% for both previous years, while the Netherlands decreased from 10% on 2002, to 9% on 2007 and finally to 8% on 2012. In contrast, France's figure fluctated over the 3 years, it started with 10% on 2002, and then 11% on 2007 making it the only country that matched the proportionate spending of Switzerland, and it finally fell to 7% on 2012.


## Gemini's critique

This is a strong Task 1 response. You have a clear grasp of the data and a solid structure. Since you are aiming for a **C2 (Band 8.5-9.0)**, I will be very strict in this evaluation to show you exactly where those tiny points are lost.

### 📊 Estimated Band Score: 7.5 - 8.0

|**Criterion**|**Score**|**Agent's Feedback**|
|---|---|---|
|**Task Achievement**|**8.0**|You accurately reported all main features and made relevant comparisons. You avoided "listing" every single data point, which is good.|
|**Coherence & Cohesion**|**8.0**|Logical paragraphing. Your overview is clear and well-placed. Using "In contrast" and "Overall" helps the flow.|
|**Lexical Resource**|**7.5**|Good use of "salient," "marginal," and "proportionate." However, there is some repetition of "figure" and "studied year."|
|**Grammar Range & Accuracy**|**7.5**|Strong overall, but a few minor preposition/article errors and one significant data misinterpretation (France) that affects accuracy.|

### 🔍 Key Areas for C2 Improvement

#### 1. Accuracy & Data Precision (The "C2" Difference)

- **The France Error:** Look closely at the chart for France in 2012 (orange bar). It is at **9%**, not **7%**. A C2 candidate must be flawless in data extraction.
    
- **Switzerland/France Comparison:** You noted France matched Switzerland in 2007 at 11%. This is a great observation! ==However, describing France's trend as "fluctuated" is slightly inaccurate; it rose and then fell. "Fluctuation" usually implies multiple ups and downs==.
    

#### 2. Advanced Sentence Structures (Inversion & Complexity)

To hit Band 9.0 in Grammar, try integrating the ==**Inversion**== we discussed:

- _Your version:_ "Estonia had the lowest figure for the same years."
    
- _C2 version:_ "**At no point** did any country spend less than Estonia, which consistently recorded the lowest proportion at 3%."
    

#### 3. Vocabulary Refinement

- **Avoid Repetition:** ==Instead of "the studied years," use "the period in question," "the timeframe mentioned," or "the specific years under interval."==
    
- **Prepositional Accuracy:** * _Incorrect:_ "expended the highest proportion of **their** GDP" $\rightarrow$ _Correct:_ "expended the highest proportion of **its** GDP" (Switzerland is a singular entity).
    
    - _Incorrect:_ "unchanged figure **on** 2002" $\rightarrow$ _Correct:_ "unchanged figure **in** 2002."

### ✍️ Edited C2-Level Version (For Study)

> The bar chart illustrates healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP ***across various European*** nations in 2002, 2007, and 2012.
> 
> Overall, the most salient feature is ***the relative stability*** of spending for the majority of the nations profiled. ***Notably***, Switzerland consistently ***allocated*** the highest proportion of its GDP to healthcare, ***whereas*** Estonia ***maintained*** the lowest expenditure throughout the ***decade***.
> 
> ***Regarding the most stable spenders***, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, and Estonia remained constant at 11%, 10%, 8%, and 3% respectively. Several ***other nations***, including Denmark and Norway, showed no change between 2002 and 2007, maintaining 9%, before both experienced a marginal ***uptick*** to 10% by 2012. A similar 1% increase in the final year was observed in Slovenia, Poland, and Lithuania.
> 
> In contrast, Luxembourg and the Netherlands saw a decline in proportionate spending over time, with the ***latter’s figure retreating*** from 10% to 8% by the end of the period. France’s data was unique; it rose to 11% in 2007—briefly equalling Switzerland’s peak—before ***receding*** to 9% in 2012.

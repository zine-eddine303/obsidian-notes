The table highlights a variety of data about metro systems in six major cities in the world.  
  
Overall, New York subway has the longer and more lines than the other cities' metro systems. On the other hand, Beijing subway makes a significant number of journeys per year in comparison to the other underground systems. Another important observation is that Mexico City has the cheapest ticket to ride the metro.  
  
The number of underground lines in New York is 24 which considerable in comparison to the other cities, this number also translates to longer rails which are almsot 660 miles, making New York subway the biggest underground system among the other studied cities. Beijing directly follows the New York in both number of lines and its length. The shortest rail network in this list is the one that Paris metro uses, while the least number of lines is London's  
  
Beijing subways travel a staggering 3.6 billion journey per year, followed by Tokyo with 3.1 billion. The city with the least number of journeys is London.  
  
Mexico city's metro is the most affordable choice for metro, while London's metro is the most expensive on the list.

### 📊 Estimated Band Score: 7.0

| Criterion                    | Score   | Agent's Feedback                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Achievement**         | **7.5** | You covered all key categories (Lines, Length, Journeys, Cost). Your overview is clear. You made effective comparisons (e.g., Mexico being cheapest). |
| **Coherence & Cohesion**     | **7.5** | Logical paragraphing based on themes (size, then usage/cost). Good use of "On the other hand" and "Overall."                                          |
| **Lexical Resource**         | **7.0** | Good use of "staggering," "affordable," and "considerable." However, there are some minor word-choice errors and typos.                               |
| **Grammar Range & Accuracy** | **6.5** | You have some comparative errors ("the longer") and punctuation issues (comma splices). These need to be fixed for C1/C2 levels.                      |
### 🔍 Key Areas for C2 Improvement

#### 1. Grammatical Precision (The Comparative)

- **Error:** "...New York subway has the **longer and more** lines..."
    
- **Correction:** "...New York City Subway has the **longest network** and the **highest number of** lines..."
    
- **C2 Rule:** When comparing more than two things, use the **superlative** (_longest/most_), not the comparative (_longer/more_).
    

#### 2. Sentence Structure (Comma Splices)

- **Error:** "...24 which considerable in comparison to the other cities, this number also translates..."
    
- **Correction:** "...24, which **is** considerable in comparison to the other cities; furthermore, this figure translates..."
    
- **C2 Strategy:** Avoid joining two independent sentences with just a comma. Use a semicolon or a transition word to show sophisticated control.
    

#### 3. Lexical Precision & "Hedged" Data

- **Correction:** Instead of "almost 660 miles," use "**approximately** 660 miles" or "**just shy of** 660 miles."
    
- **Spelling:** "Almsot" → **Almost**; "Mecanical" (from your last essay) → **Mechanical**.

### ✍️ The C2-Level Rewrite (Model Answer)

> The provided table illustrates various ==operational statistics== for underground rail ==networks== across ==six global metropolises==.
> 
> Overall, the New York City Subway stands out as the most ==extensive== network in terms of both ==line count== and total track length. ==Conversely==, ==Asian== systems in Beijing and Tokyo dominate in terms of annual ==ridership==, while London’s network represents the most expensive option for ==commuters==.
> 
> In terms of infrastructure, New York City ==boasts== the largest system, featuring 24 lines covering a total of 659 miles. Beijing follows as the second largest, with 19 lines ==spanning== 357 miles. ==At the opposite end of the spectrum==, the London Tube operates just 11 lines, and the Paris Metro possesses the shortest track length at ==a mere== 127 miles.
> 
> Regarding usage and ==affordability==, the Beijing Subway records a staggering 3.6 billion annual journeys, ==narrowly surpassing== Tokyo’s 3.1 billion. ==In stark contrast==, London sees the lowest ridership at 1.2 billion. Economically, Mexico City offers the most accessible ==transit== with tickets priced at $0.23, whereas London’s single ==fare== is nearly ==thirty times more== expensive at $7.30.

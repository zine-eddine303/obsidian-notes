The two maps illustrate the structural and residential transformation of Westley town between 1815 and the present day.

Overall, Westly has been significantly urbanized and became a residential and a business hub after being a mostly green and agricultural place. 

In 1815, Westly had a bridge that crossed the River Twine on the west side leading to London. Now a raleway has been laid from south to north from the western side of the town crossing the same river. A train station was built to be accessible by the extended road on the western south corner, a cinema was also built on the same road extension. The later infrastructer resulted in the removal of the fields that occupied a big portion of this town

A cluster of houses were demolished and replaced by housing and business facilities on the eastern south of Westly. The market square and the town hall stayed on their original location. 

Finally, on the eastern north of the new city we find that woods have been cut down to make room for more residential buildings. We can also notice that the big house of lord Westly has been demolished and 2 buildings were place in place: The red lion and Lenton hotel.

### 🔍 Critical Fixes for C2 Precision

#### 1. Spelling Accuracy (Priority #1)

At the C2 level, spelling errors in basic words are heavily penalized.

- **Westly** → **Westley** (Always double-check the spelling of proper nouns provided in the prompt).
    
- ==**Raleway**== → **Railway**.
    
- **Infrastructer** → **Infrastructure**.
    
- **Later** → **Latter** (Use "latter" when referring to the second of two things mentioned).
    

#### 2. Prepositional & Article Precision

- **"On the western south corner"** → **"In the ==southwestern== corner."** (Using compass directions as single adjectives like _southwestern, ==northeastern==, or ==southeastern_== is more academic).
    
- **"2 buildings were place in place"** → **"Two buildings were ==erected== in its place."** (Avoid using the digit "2"; write out numbers ten and under).
    

#### 3. Advanced Comparison Structures

Instead of just saying things "changed," use **Subordinating Conjunctions** to show a high level of grammatical control:

- _Your version:_ "The market square and the town hall stayed on their original location."
    
- _C2 Upgrade:_ "==**While** the market square and town hall remained in their original locations, the surrounding church and residential cluster were repurposed for commercial use.=="

### 💡 The "Passive Voice" Power-Up

In map tasks, the town doesn't change itself—it is changed by people. Therefore, the **Passive Voice** is your best friend. You used it well in a few places; try to make it even more sophisticated:

- **Active:** "We find that woods have been cut down."
    
- **C2 Passive:** "The woodland area ==**was cleared** to facilitate== the construction of a housing estate."


# Gemini's essay
The two maps illustrate the significant infrastructural and residential transformations that have occurred in the town of Westley from 1815 to the present day.

Overall, Westley has transitioned from a primarily agrarian village into a modernized urban center. The most striking changes include the total removal of agricultural fields in favor of commercial zones and the introduction of a railway system that has redefined the town's western boundary.

In 1815, the western part of Westley was dominated by large fields. These have since been entirely repurposed; in their place now stands a cinema and a major railway station, with a north-south railway line cutting through the landscape where the Twine Toll Bridge once stood. The River Twine remains, but its role as a primary transport crossing appears diminished by the railway.

Central and eastern Westley have also undergone extensive redevelopment. The area previously occupied by a church and a cluster of small houses has been converted into a museum and the West Gate Shopping Centre. Furthermore, the "Lenton Woods" have been cleared to make way for the Lenton Housing Estate. While some historical landmarks like the Town Hall and Market Square remain in their original positions, the surrounding areas have been designated as expansive business and residential zones. To the northeast, Lord Westley’s House and the Coach Inn have been replaced by the Lenton Hotel and a pub called The Red Lion, reflecting a shift from private estates to commercial hospitality.

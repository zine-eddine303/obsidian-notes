_**The diagram below shows the water cycle in both forested and urban areas.**_

_**Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.**_

The given diagram illustrates how water cycle differs between forested and urban locations.

Overall, it is clear that the water cycle in urban areas is starkly different than it is on forests. While both areas ==~~have the same chance of rain~~== percipitation, water ==returning to the atmosphere== is weak in comparison to that of forests; furthermore, water erosion is almost ==negligeable== in forests compared to cities, where erosion is very high.

Water evaporation and transpiration are considerably reduced in ==urabnized== territories in comparison with that of forests. Runoff is dense and ==poluted== in cities; however, water runoff is reduced and cleaner in forests.

A deep analysis of the diagram reveals that water infiltration from permeable topsoil to the less permeable subsoil on rock is reduced in urban areas if we compare it with forested places==,== this also applies to baseflow. We can also conclude that water passes between the topsoil and subsoil in cities, resulting in increased erosion, which is almost ==inexistant== in forests.

### 🔍 Critique: The "100% Rule" Check

1. **Spelling Errors:** * "Urabnized" ❌ → **Urbanized** ✅
    
    - "Poluted" ❌ → **Polluted** ✅
        
    - "Negligeable" ❌ → **Negligible** ✅ (Note: You made this same mistake in the previous essay—this is a "fossilized error" you must fix for Jan 10th!)
        
    - "Inexistant" ❌ → **Non-existent** ✅
        
2. **Word Choice:**
    
    - "Same chance of rain" is a bit informal. The diagram uses the word **Precipitation**. Use that instead.
        
    - "Water returning to the atmosphere is weak." A better way to say this is "**rates of** evaporation and transpiration are **significantly lower**."
        
3. **Grammar (The Comma Splice):**
    
    - In your last paragraph, you joined two complete sentences with just a comma: "...forested places, this also applies to baseflow." You should use a semicolon (;) or a full stop.

### 🚀 Enhanced C2-Level Version

Here is how to describe this diagram using the **Precise Naturalness** we discussed.

The diagram compares the hydrological cycle in forested and urban environments.

**Overall**, it is clear that natural forest cover **facilitates** high levels of water absorption and atmospheric return, whereas urban landscapes **disrupt** these processes, leading to increased surface runoff and environmental degradation.

In forested areas, **precipitation** is largely managed through natural processes. Significant amounts of water return to the air via **evaporation** and **transpiration**. Furthermore, the **permeable** topsoil allows for substantial **infiltration** into the subsoil, which maintains a healthy **water table** and steady **baseflow**. Consequently, surface **runoff** is minimal and the water remains clean.

**In sharp contrast**, urban settings feature man-made structures that prevent natural absorption. Rates of evaporation and transpiration are **curtailed**, and the lack of permeable surfaces leads to **reduced infiltration**. This causes a **surge** in polluted runoff, which flows directly into water bodies. Finally, because water cannot sink into the ground, it moves rapidly between soil layers, resulting in **heightened erosion** compared to the stable conditions found in forests.

### 📖 Vocabulary Breakdown & Definitions

As requested, here are the definitions for the technical and high-level words used:

- **Facilitates (Verb):** To make an action or process easy or easier.
    
    - _Usage:_ "Trees **facilitate** the absorption of water into the ground."
        
- **Disrupt (Verb):** To interrupt an event, activity, or process by causing a disturbance or problem.
    
- **Precipitation (Noun):** Rain, snow, sleet, or hail that falls to the ground. (The professional term for "rain").
    
- **Transpiration (Noun):** The process where plants absorb water through their roots and then give off water vapor through their leaves.
    
- **Permeable (Adjective):** Allowing liquids or gases to pass through it.
    
    - _Usage:_ "Sand is more **permeable** than concrete."
        
- **Infiltration (Noun):** The process by which water on the ground surface enters the soil.
    
- **Baseflow (Noun):** The portion of streamflow that comes from "underground" water (groundwater) rather than direct rain runoff.
    
- **Curtailed (Verb):** To reduce in extent or quantity; to impose a restriction on.
    
    - _Usage:_ "Urbanization has **curtailed** the natural water cycle."
        
- **Surge (Noun/Verb):** A sudden powerful forward or upward movement.

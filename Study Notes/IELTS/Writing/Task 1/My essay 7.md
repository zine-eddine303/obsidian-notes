The given diagram illustrates how water cycle differs between forested and urban locations.

Overall, it is clear that the water cycle in urban areas is starkly different than it is on forests. While both areas have the same chance of rain, water returning to the atmosphere is weak in comparison to that of forests; furthermore, water erosion is almost negligeable in forests compared to cities, where erosion is very high.

Water evaporation and transpiration are considerably reduced in urabnized territories in comparison with that of forests. Runoff is dense and poluted in cities; however, water runoff is reduced and cleaner in forests.

A deep analysis of the diagram reveals that water infiltration from permeable topsoil to the less permeable subsoil on rock is reduced in urban areas if we compare it with forested places, this also applies to baseflow. We can also conclude that water passes between the topsoil and subsoil in cities, resulting in increased erosion, which is almost inexistant in forests.

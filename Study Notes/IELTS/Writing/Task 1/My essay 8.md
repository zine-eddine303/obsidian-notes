The two graphs illustrate the amount of mobile phone subscribtions and fixed phone subscribtions per hundred individuals from year 2005 to 2015 for four different countries: Eritrea, India, United Kingdom, and Uruguay.

Overall, the UK and Uruguay have greater subscribtions for both mobile and fixed phones than the other two countries. It is also clear that both types of ==subcribtions== in Eritrea were marginal, while India's mobile subcribtions increased over the years, and remained ==negligeable== for fixed phone subscribtions.

Mobile phone subscribers the United Kingdom were evaluated at 100 ==on== 2005 and slightly increased to around 120 on 2007, making it the country with the most subscribers. While this figure steadily remained at that value for the rest of the years, Uruguay's figure surpassed it on 2009 and reached 150 ==subscribtions== per hundred people on 2015, after starting with less that 50 on 2005. In contrast, the figure for fixed phone ==subscribtions== in the UK was always greater than Uruguay, with 60 ==subscriptions== per hunderd people for the UK, and 30 for Uruguay.

Eritrea's values were marginal for both types of ==subscribtions==; ==H==owever, India's figures ==raised== from 0 to around 70 for mobile, but it also was marginal for all the period for fixed phones.

This is a solid start for a Task 1 essay. You have followed the correct structure: **Introduction**, **Overview**, and **Body Paragraphs**.

To reach a **C1/C2 level**, we need to fix some recurring spelling errors, improve your "trend" verbs (e.g., using _rose_ instead of _raised_), and ensure your data comparisons are sharp.

Below is a polished version of your essay. I have kept your natural voice but corrected the "score plungers" (grammar/spelling) and added **precise** vocabulary.

### 📝 Polished IELTS Task 1 Response

The two line graphs compare the **number** of mobile and fixed telephone subscriptions per hundred people across four nations—Eritrea, India, the UK, and Uruguay—over a ten-year period from 2005 to 2015.

**Overall**, mobile phone subscriptions saw a **significant upward trend** in almost all countries, whereas fixed-line subscriptions remained relatively **stable or declined**. It is also clear that the UK and Uruguay maintained substantially higher connectivity rates than India and Eritrea throughout the entire period.

Regarding mobile subscriptions, the UK **stood at** 100 in 2005, the highest at the time, before **plateauing** at approximately 125 from 2007 onwards. In contrast, Uruguay experienced **exponential growth**, starting below 50 in 2005 and eventually **surpassing** the UK in 2009 to reach 150 by 2015. India also saw a notable **climb** from near zero to roughly 80, while Eritrea's figures remained **negligible**.

In terms of fixed telephone lines, the trends were much flatter. The UK started with the highest figures at nearly 60, but this gradually **ebbed** to just over 50 by 2015. Uruguay's subscriptions **fluctuated** slightly around the 30 mark. Similar to the mobile data, both India and Eritrea saw **minimal** activity in this sector, with both countries staying below 5 subscriptions per hundred people for the duration of the period.

### 📖 Vocabulary & Grammar "Reality Check"

Based on the "Natural English" rules we discussed, here are the words I used to replace your draft's weaker points:

- **Subscriptions (Spelling Fix):** Note the spelling has one 'b' and ends in 'ptions'.
    
- **Stood at (Verb):** A natural way to describe a starting point on a graph.
    
- **Plateauing (Verb):** This means to reach a state of little or no change after a period of activity. It's much better than "remained at that value."
    
- **Surpassing (Verb):** To go past or become greater than. This is a key word for **making comparisons**, which is a specific requirement of the task.
    
- **Ebbed (Verb):** To gradually lessen or reduce. It's a natural, sophisticated way to describe a slow decline.
    
- **Negligible / Minimal (Adjectives):** Use these instead of "marginal" to describe very low numbers.
    
- **Duration of the period (Phrase):** A more professional way to say "for all the rest of the years."

## Punctuation

> **Your sentence:** "Eritrea's values were marginal for both types of subscribtions; However, India's figures raised..."

- **The Verdict:** **Technically correct use, but with a capitalization error.**
    
- **The Rule:** When you use a semicolon to join two independent sentences with a word like _however_, the word following the semicolon should **not** start with a capital letter (unless it is a proper noun like a name).
    
- **The Correction:** "...both types of subscriptions; **h**owever, India's figures **rose**..."

### ⚠️ Error Correction from your Draft:

1. **"Raised" vs. "Rose":**
    
    - _Your version:_ "India's figures raised..."
        
    - _Correction:_ "India's figures **rose**..."
        
    - _The Rule:_ "Raise" needs an object (You raise your hand). "Rise/Rose" happens on its own (The sun rises; Prices rose).
        
2. **Prepositions of Time:**
    
    - _Your version:_ "on 2005"
        
    - _Correction:_ "**In** 2005"
        
    - _The Rule:_ Use "in" for years, months, and centuries. Use "on" for specific days (on Monday, on January 1st).
        
3. **Spelling:**
    
    - "Subscribtions" ❌ → **Subscriptions** ✅
        
    - "Hunderd" ❌ → **Hundred** ✅
        
    - "Negligeable" ❌ → **Negligible** ✅

The two graphs illustrate the amount of mobile phone subscribtions and fixed phone subscribtions per hundred individuals from year 2005 to 2015 for four different countries: Eritrea, India, United Kingdom, and Uruguay.

Overall, the UK and Uruguay have greater subscribtions for both mobile and fixed phones than the other two countries. It is also clear that both types of subcribtions in Eritrea were marginal, while India's mobile subcribtions increased over the years, and remained negligeable for fixed phone subscribtions.

Mobile phone subscribers the United Kingdom were evaluated at 100 on 2005 and slightly increased to around 120 on 2007, making it the country with the most subscribers. While this figure steadily remained at that value for the rest of the years, Uruguay's figure surpassed it on 2009 and reached 150 subscribtions per hundred people on 2015, after starting with less that 50 on 2005. In contrast, the figure for fixed phone subscribtions in the UK was always greater than Uruguay, with 60 subscriptions per hunderd people for the UK, and 30 for Uruguay.

Eritrea's values were marginal for both types of subscribtions; However, India's figures raised from 0 to around 70 for mobile, but it also was marginal for all the period for fixed phones.

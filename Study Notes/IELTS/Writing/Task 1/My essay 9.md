Some individuals argue that educational institutions are so competitive that they leave negative impact on pupils; on the other hand, others agree with the challenging environment in schools as it helps them succeed. This essay believes of the latter view.

It is no wonder that schools are competitive by design in many aspects, such as exams and sports. Constant pressure for being the best in and competing for the first place can be exhausting and may lead to some serious psychological complications for young individuals such as anxiety. Furthermore, the challenging environment may be unfair for some children who may be less advantagious. Many kids were unfortunately not raised in an circle that helps them to learn from a young age, meaning that school might be the first time they encounter the concept of learning which makes it hard for them to catch up with their friends who may have been more familiar with these concepts.

While there are some disadvantages to the challenging nature of schools, a positive side does indeed exist for it. Schools are not made only to learn how to spell and calculate, they also prepare the children for the real world which is very competitive and it is not easy to achieve great things without hard work. In addition, children will become mentally strong by surpassing hardships in school, which prepares them to be great leaders and contributors tin their society.

In conclusion, while some disadvantages for competition in schools exist, I believe that these hardships are worth it for them to become prepared for the real world.

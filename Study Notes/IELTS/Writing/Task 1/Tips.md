# Don'ts

- You dont have to understand what the topic is, like here it's "foreign direct investment"
- They are not asking for your opinion on this topic
- Don't be very detailed in your analysis, they only need a superficial analysis. Remember, you are not a data analyst or an economist
- Don't complicate it
- Don't try to impress the writer
- Don't say "this data is so simple, there must be something that I am not seeing" because you are wrong, they inentionally make data simple and obvious

# Do's

- They are asking you to ==understand== the data and ==report== it appropriately and make ==relevant comparisons==
- They are asking you to "summarise", and select the most important features and report them
- Keep it simple
- Organise paragraphs logically

# Steps to do before writing

1. Think about the purpose of the data to understand the data. for our example there are 2 purposes
	- A comparison between china and india in foreign direct investment
	- A trend over time of foreign direct investment

2. Understand the general trends (is it incresing, decreasing, steady or fluctuating...)
	- **For china**: the trend is decreasing, with a sudden peak in 2018, but its generally decreasing
	- **For India:** It is fluctuating, no significant changes

3. Look for points of comparison
	- China had a major peak in 2018
	- Overall the foreign direct investment in China is greater than in India

# Structure of essay

1. **Introduction**
	- It's always normally one sentence paragraph
	- Paraphrase the paragraph that introduces the data 
		- When you mention the topic (like in this case it's "foreign direct investment"), if you really know a synonym of it then use it, if not, DON'T. You are not obliged to know these topics

2. **Overview** (1)
	- The position of this paragraph doesn't matter, it could be the second paragraph or any other postion
	- Always starts with "Overall,"
	- Look at the data and report from 2 to 4 of the most important features without reporting any specific data
	- Don't mention any values from any of the axis (in order to eleminate details)
	- Try to group features (especially if there's more than 2 sets of data)
		- For example: ==bread and buns== appear to have been more profitable than ==pies==

3. Detail paragraph #1
	- Talk about one country (china for this case)
	- Dive into details and values for the change in the data, but still don't report each and every single thing, only point out relevant points

4. Detail paragraph #2
	- Talk about the other country (India for this case)
	- Dive into details like u did in the previous paragraph
	- Compare this data with the previous one (China and India),

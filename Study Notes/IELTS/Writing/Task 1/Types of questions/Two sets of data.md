# Strategy

**Paragraph 1** (Intro)

- Sentence 1- Paraphrase question sentences.

	There will normally be two question sentences and you should combine them into one sentence by using ‘and’ or ‘while’. This will allow you to produce a complex sentence and gain points for grammatical range and accuracy.

**Paragraph 2** (overview) 

- Sentence 2- [Overview](https://www.ieltsadvantage.com/2015/05/13/ielts-task-1-overview/) of two of the main features from graph number 1.
- Sentence 3- Overview of two of the main features from graph number 2.
- Sentence 4- Overview of any comparisons if necessary (optional).

**Paragraph 3** (Data 1)

- Sentence 5- Details of **first** main feature of graph number **1**,
- Sentence 6- Details of **second** main feature of graph number **1**.

**Paragraph 4** (Data 2)

- Sentence 7- Details of **first** main feature of graph number **2.**
- Sentence 8- Details of **second** main feature of graph number **2**.
- Sentence 9- Details of any comparisons (if any).

	So paragraph 2 should just be an overview of the main features and should not include any details. The details come in paragraphs 3 and 4.

**Answer**

The pie graph displays the principal causes why farming land deteriorates while the table illustrates how three regions of the planet were affected by these factors in the 1990s.

	_As you can see all I have done is change the words in the questions using synonyms and then connected them using the word ‘while’._ 

We can clearly see from the pie chart that there are three primary causes of farmland degradation, and over-grazing is the major one. The table shows that Europe had a far higher percentage of unproductive land compared to the other two regions in this time period.

	_For this paragraph I have picked out the main features from each graph and wrote them in a general way. Notice that I have not included any numbers. We will support our ideas with number in the next two paragraphs. Also, notice that I am using the present simple for the pie chart because there is no date and the past tense for the table because it was in the 1990s._ 

The pie chart represents four causes, with over-grazing representing the biggest proportion at just over a third. Widespread clearing of trees and the over-use of crops constitute nearly one third and just over a quarter respectively.

	_Here I have varied my language by using synonyms for the causes and proportions and fractions for the data._

The table shows that nearly one quarter of Europe’s entire surface had fallen victim to degeneration. Only a small proportion of North America’s total land became less productive at 5% and Oceania was marginally higher with a value of 13%.

# Comparison with [Discussion essay](obsidian://open?vault=Web%20Developement&file=Study%20Notes%2FIELTS%2FWriting%2FTask%202%2FEssay%20types%2FDiscussion%20essays)

- **Opinion (Agree/Disagree):** You can take a **one-sided approach**. You choose a side in the introduction and support it throughout. You don't _have_ to talk about the other side unless it helps prove your point.

- **Discussion:** You **must** devote a full body paragraph to "View A" and a full body paragraph to "View B" before giving your opinion. If you don't discuss _both_ views equally, you fail the task requirements.

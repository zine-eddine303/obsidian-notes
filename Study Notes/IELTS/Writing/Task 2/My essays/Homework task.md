## Introduction

In the last few years, we see more and more vehicles driven by artificial intelligence. This is a result of the technological advancements that's happening in all fields and I believe that this is a good thing, since it makes our lives easier and safer.

## Evaluation

# Write a main body

## Main body

The main goal of this new technology is to solve traffic related problems. Artificial intellignece driven cars use a system that allows them to move more effectively ==and create an error-free traffic==, which helps reduce accidents and traffic jams. For example, Tesla cars can detect anomalies in the road and rapidly makes decisions to avoid crashing, or reduce casualties if crashing is inevitable.

This technology should be viewed as a positive developement, as it increases road safety ==and allows for a synergic traffic== which can't be achieved with traditional manual driving. A study in the 2000s suggested that using innovative road intersections and implementing more advanced traffic light systems isn't the real answer to a better traffic, the best solution to this problem are self driving cars.

- [ ] Is the first example good enough?
- [x] Is the second example good enough?
- [x] Does your examples make sense?
- [x] Does your examples directly support your main points?
- [x] Does your main match what you stated in the introduction?
- [x] Does your explanation actually explain how your main point answers the question?

## Corrected version

The main goal of this new technology is to solve traffic related problems. Artificial intellignece driven cars use a system that allows them to ==navigate== more effectively ==and allows to create an error-free traffic==, ==this== helps reduce accidents and traffic jams. For example, Tesla cars can ==instantly== detect anomalies in the road and rapidly makes decisions to avoid  ==collision== or reduce casualties if crashing is inevitable.

# Write a Conclusion

## Conclusion

In conclusion, artificial intelligence is ==dominating== cars these years as it solves most traffic problems and this new technology should be welcomed because it might allow us to finally have flawless roads, clear from accidents and errors.

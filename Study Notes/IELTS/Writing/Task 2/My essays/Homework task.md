## Introduction

In the last few years, we see more and more vehicles driven by artificial intelligence. This is a result of the technological advancements that's happening in all fields and I believe that this is a good thing, since it makes our lives easier and safer.

## Evaluation

- [x] Topic (technology)
- [x] Simple ideas
- [x] Used the ideas that I can talk about
- [x] Chose the easiest side (positive)
- [x] Most obvious ideas (tech advancement, makes life easier and safer)
- [x] No "amazing" ideas
- [x] No complex words
- [x] Structure respected
- [x] Paraphrased effectively
- [x] No vocabulary errors
- [ ] No Grammar errors
- [x] No more than 2 ideas
- [ ] Specfic and clear (not vague) ideas

## Corrected version

==In these last years,== we see more and more vehicles driven by artificial intelligence. ==This is an attempt to solve traffic problems== and I believe that this is a good thing, ==because== it makes our lives safer and easier.

# Write a main body

## Main body

The main goal of this new technology is to solve traffic related problems. Artificial intellignece driven cars use a system that allows them to move more effectively ==and create an error-free traffic==, which helps reduce accidents and traffic jams. For example, Tesla cars can detect anomalies in the road and rapidly makes decisions to avoid crashing, or reduce casualties if crashing is inevitable.

This technology should be viewed as a positive developement, as it increases road safety ==and allows for a synergic traffic== which can't be achieved with traditional manual driving. A study in the 2000s suggested that using innovative road intersections and implementing more advanced traffic light systems isn't the real answer to a better traffic, the best solution to this problem are self driving cars.

## Evaluation

- [x] Did you introduce the topic sentence for each part?
- [ ] Is the grammar perfect?
- [x] Did you avoid repeating words and phrases multiple times?
- [x] Are the paragraphs distinctful? 
- [x] Did you have a clear position on the topic? 
- [x] Did you include the ideas that you use in the introduction (cohesion)
- [ ] Is the first example good enough?

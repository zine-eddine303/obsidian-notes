## Essay

Maintaining a small local business can be challenging due to the aggressive ==competetiveness== of large businesses such as large supermarkets and online shops.

	You have to also mention the answer to the two questions that you were asked in the introduction


A few large supermarkets and online shops have already ==consumed the market== and formed a monopoly, making them the only options available for consumers. This is due to many factors that tipped the economy to their side; for instance, they establish contracts with important companies like ==notorious brands== and suppliers. Furthermore, these monopolies are likely to possess some huge capitals, which allow them to invest heavily in ==tradition== and digital marketing, expansions and ==aquiremnts==, hence crushing small competitors easily. In stark contrast, small shops generally have limited ==ressoures== and connections which prohibits them from expanding and gaining traction against their big competitors.

	"Notorious" means famous for something bad (like a criminal)

This ~~==imballance==~~ creates negative impact on local communities. The absence of competitveness in a market invokes a rise in prices which would be inflated by the establishments who control that market to grow their profits. In addition to high prices, regular consumers would face limited choices in ~~==marchendise==~~ merchendise and would be forced to take what is available.

To solve this intricate problem, the government should intervene and place regulations and laws that prohibit the formation of such monopolies, by forcing suppliers and brands to work with all businesses regardless of their size or status. It would also be a good practice to allow small shop to catch up with the competition by reducing taxes on these shops.

~~To summarize~~ In conclusion, the monopoly of large businesses on small shops have negative impact on people, the government can put a stop to this by implementing multiple ~~==stategies==~~ strategies to help these small businesses flourish. 

	The conclusion is important in this type of questions
	Use "in conclusion" in the begining of the conclusion

Based on current IELTS criteria, this essay would likely score a **Band 6.5 - 7.0**. The main reason it isn't higher yet is the high frequency of spelling errors and some slightly "unnatural" word choices.

---

### 🔍 Critique: The "Naturalness & Accuracy" Check

Following the advice from your IELTS teacher's video, let's look at how to improve this without being "robotic."

#### 1. Spelling (The "100% Rule")

You have several recurring spelling mistakes. In a Band 8.0+ essay, spelling errors are very rare.

- **Competetiveness** ❌ → **Competitiveness** ✅
- **Aquiremnts** ❌ → **Acquisitions** ✅ (This is the professional term for buying other companies).
- **Ressoures** ❌ → **Resources** ✅
- **Imballance** ❌ → **Imbalance** ✅
- **Marchendise** ❌ → **Merchandise** ✅
- **Stategies** ❌ → **Strategies** ✅

#### 2. Word Choice (Connotation)

- **"Notorious brands"**: In English, **notorious** means famous for something _bad_ (like a criminal). For big companies, use **well-known**, **renowned**, or **prominent**.
- **"Consume the market"**: A more natural way to say this is **dominate the market**.
- **"Invest heavily in tradition marketing"**: You mean **traditional** marketing (TV, radio, newspapers).

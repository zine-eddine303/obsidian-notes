### ⚠️ Common Error Fixes for your "Idea Bank":

- **Diner vs. Dinner:**
    - A **diner** is a person who eats or a type of small restaurant.
    - **Dinner** is the meal you eat in the evening. (Remember: Two 'n's for the meal!)
- **Governments:**
    
    - Always remember the "**n**" in the middle: Gover-**n**-ments.
        
- **Enroll in:**
    
    - You don't "enroll to" a sport; you **enroll in** a class or a club.
        
- **"Are require":**
    
    - Incorrect: "Activities are require sitting still."
        
    - Correct: "Activities **require** sitting still." (Simple present tense).

# Essay

Scientific experiments on animals are one of the most controvertial topics in our society. People are divided to two main groups, the first group is composed of those who oppose these practices, while the other is formed of people who accept the experiments.

Personally, I belong to the individuals who do not approve of the practice of performing experiments on animals. I believe that these methods are unethical and cannot be justified. Animals are weak beings that can not give or deny consent to such activities. A handful of these experiments are cruel and painful to any living entity.

However, this type of science experiments can be performed without harming these helpless beings, and can even be carried out without directly involving them. Computer simulation is a prime alternative which is possible now due to the advancements in science and technology in the current era. This technique allows researchers to model systems of any type; electrical, structural, mecanical and even biomedical systems. Since countless experiments had already been done on animals throughout the history, resulting in valuable data and informations, these can be used to feed the numerical systems to create a digital environment where academics and researchers can perform experiments without boundaries and without hurting any living soul.

To sum up, experimentations on animals are unethical due to the helpnessness of these beings, additionnally, these actions can be painful if not leathal which makes animals suffer on the process. Multiple alternatives exist to prevent this, notably computer simulations that open the door to ethical, painless and even cheaper and broader experiments.

## ✍️ The C2-Level Rewrite (300+ Words)

Observe how this version uses **Inversion**, **Conditional Clauses**, and **Passive Voice** while meeting the word count requirement.

> The morality of utilizing animals for scientific research remains one of the most **contentious** issues in modern discourse. While proponents point to life-saving breakthroughs, a growing segment of the population demands an outright ban on these practices. In my view, animal experimentation is fundamentally unjustifiable on ethical grounds; furthermore, I believe that technological evolution has provided us with superior alternatives.
> 
> **At no point** can the infliction of pain upon sentient, non-consenting beings be truly justified. Animals, though physically weaker, possess a nervous system capable of experiencing profound distress and agony. To subject them to invasive procedures for human gain is a violation of basic biological ethics. Moreover, many argue that discoveries made in a laboratory setting often fail to translate perfectly to human physiology, rendering much of the suffering unnecessary.
> 
> However, the transition toward a more humane scientific model is already underway, largely driven by the digital revolution. **Were it not for** current advancements in computational power, we might still be entirely reliant on biological models. Computer simulations now serve as a prime alternative, allowing researchers to construct intricate digital environments. By utilizing the vast repositories of data gathered from previous historical experiments, academics can now model structural, mechanical, and even biomedical systems with high precision. Such numerical modeling not only eliminates the need for living subjects but often proves to be more cost-effective and scalable than traditional methods.
> 
> In conclusion, the helplessness of animals makes their exploitation for research purposes ethically indefensible, particularly when the results are often **lethal**. **Not only** are there moral imperatives to stop these practices, but the advent of sophisticated computer simulations also offers a path forward that is both scientifically robust and compassionate. Consequently, society must prioritize the funding and implementation of these digital alternatives to ensure that scientific progress is no longer synonymous with suffering.

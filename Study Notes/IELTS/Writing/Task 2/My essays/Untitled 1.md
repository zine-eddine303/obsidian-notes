# Essay

Scientific experiments on animals are one of the most controvertial topics in our society. People are divided to two main groups, the first group is composed of those who oppose these practices, while the other is formed of people who accept the experiments.

Personally, I belong to the individuals who do not approve of the practice of performing experiments on animals. I believe that these methods are unjustifiable. Animals are weak beings that can not give or deny consent to such activities. A handful of these experiments are cruel and painful to any living entity.

However, this type of science experiments can be performed without harming these helpless beings, and can even be carried out without directly involving them. Computer simulation is a prime example as an alternative, nowadays science and technology advancements allow researchers to model systems of any type; electrical, structural, mecanical and even biomedical systems. Countless experiments had already been done on animals throughout the history which resulted in valuable data and informations, they can be used to feed the numerical systems to create a digital environment where academics and researchers can perform experiments without boundaries and without hurting any living soul.

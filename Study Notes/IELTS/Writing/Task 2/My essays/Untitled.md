There has always been a debate between people about which phase the person is happier, his teenage phase or his adulthood. While experiences may differ from a person to person, this essay agrees that the adult years are more joyfull than the teenage years.

A large portion of people genuinly believe that they are happier than they were in their teenage years, they enjoy their time more than they did in their past inspite of the hardships of the adult life. Being a grown up allows you to have more control over your life, you get to do your own choices and make your own decisions. Furthermore, if you do certain things correctly, you will certanly have the means which allow you to do what you love, and to take care of your loved ones. For example, raising a family could bring a lot of happiness to your life, it is undoubtful that most parents love their children and are happy to watch them grow and succeed.

However, many say that teenage years happiness is incomparable to the other periods. They might say this because of the lack of responsibilities that they may have now as adults, or because they no longer have time to do what they love. I believe that these are unevitable consequences of growing up and I think that we should adapt to this reality rather than complain because as mentionned earlier, when you are an adult, you are in control. Being a teenager puts the person under the control of parents, and since he can't have a job, he wouldn't be financially sufficient and thus, he would be unable to practice his passions effectively. For example, in my teenage years I wansn't allowed to travel alone because I wasn't mature enough, and even when I was allowed to, I wasn't able to afford those long trips that I loved.

In conclusion, the happiest period of a person's lifetime is a common debate amongst people. I believe that adulthood is better than the teenage period mainly because of the freedom and control that you have over your life, which you can't have as a teenager. If an adult works hard enough and manages his time cleverly, he would be able to enjoy life as much as he wants.

### Areas for Improvement:

- **"Joyfull"**: Spelling error. It should be "joyful."
- **"Genuinly"**: Should be "genuinely."
- **"Inspite"**: Should be "in spite" (two words).
- **"Certanly"**: Should be "certainly."
- **"Undoubtful"**: A better word choice would be "undoubtedly."
- **"Unevitable"**: Should be "inevitable."
- **"Wansn't"**: Should be "wasn't."
- **"Mentionned"**: Should be "mentioned."

#### 2. **Word Choice**:

- **"There has always been a debate between people about which phase the person is happier"**: Could be more concise and natural as "There has always been debate over which phase of life brings more happiness: teenage years or adulthood."

They enjoy life more despite the hardships of adult life."

- **"For example, raising a family could bring a lot of happiness to your life, it is undoubtful that most parents love their children and are happy to watch them grow and succeed."**: The sentence could be refined for clarity: "For example, raising a family can bring great happiness, as most parents undoubtedly love their children and take joy in watching them grow and succeed."

### Revised Version (Suggestions):

There has long been debate over which phase of life brings more happiness: teenage years or adulthood. While experiences vary from person to person, this essay argues that adult years are generally more joyful than teenage years.

Many people genuinely believe they are happier as adults than they were in their teenage years. Despite the hardships of adult life, they find more fulfillment and enjoyment. Being an adult allows you to have greater control over your life—you can make your own decisions and pursue what makes you happy. Furthermore, if you manage your responsibilities well, you can enjoy the means to do what you love and take care of those you care about. For example, raising a family can bring immense happiness, as most parents take pride in watching their children grow and succeed.

On the other hand, some argue that the happiness of teenage years is incomparable to that of adulthood. This is often attributed to the lack of responsibilities teenagers experience, or the fact that adults may no longer have time to engage in their passions. However, I believe these are inevitable consequences of growing up, and it is important to adapt to this reality. As mentioned earlier, adults have the freedom to shape their own lives, whereas teenagers are often under the control of their parents and lack the financial independence to fully pursue their interests. For instance, in my teenage years, I was not allowed to travel alone because I was not deemed mature enough, and even when I was allowed to, I could not afford the trips I longed for.

In conclusion, the debate over the happiest phase of life is subjective, but I believe adulthood is more fulfilling than teenage years due to the freedom and control it provides. With hard work and effective time management, adults can enjoy life to the fullest, something that is often more challenging during the teenage years.

*Some people think that the teenage years are the happiest time of most peopleâ€™s lives. Others think that adult life brings more happiness, in spite of greater responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.*

There has always been a debate between people about which phase the person is happier, his teenage phase or his adulthood. While experiences may differ from a person to person, this essay agrees that adult years are more joyfull than teenage years.

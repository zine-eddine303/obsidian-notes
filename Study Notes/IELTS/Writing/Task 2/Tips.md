# Double-question essays

This guide focuses on **double-question essays**. However, the some principles that we will cover here apply to other types of questions.

### Example Question

_"Nowadays, more tasks at home and work are being performed by robots. Why do you think this is happening? Is it a positive or negative development?"_

## Do's and Don'ts

### Don'ts

1. **Don't just read sample essays** expecting to improve without practice.
2. **Don't read fake sample essays** — always use reliable sources.
3. **Don't try to evaluate sample essays** or compare yourself to them, as you're not at an examiner's level to make that judgment.

### Do's

1. **Get a sample essay** from [sample writing essays.docx](E:\ELT\IELTS\sample-writing-essays.docx). Cover the essay, read the question, and think:
    - "What is the simplest idea that answers this question?"
    - Imagine asking 100 people; what would the most common answer be?
    - Write your ideas down, then compare them with the essay's ideas. If they’re similar, you're on the right track. If different, check whether your ideas are relevant to the question.
2. **Develop one idea** from the sample essay into a body paragraph, then compare it with the sample. Evaluate the structure and logic.
3. **Study the essay structure**:
    - For example, in a question like: _"Some people believe that (idea 1) while others think (idea 2). Discuss both views and give your opinion."_
4. **Look for linking words** (cohesive devices) like: _for example, in other words, for instance, in conclusion_.
    - Use them sparingly (4 per essay is enough).
    - Understand why they were used in that specific context.
5. **Analyze grammatical structures and tenses** in the samples.
6. **Broaden your vocabulary** by identifying new words in the questions and sample essays. Add these to your personal dictionary.
7. **Reinforce weaknesses** by writing your own essay and comparing its structure (not just the content) to the sample.

### Double-Question Essay Structure

1. **Introduction**: Introduce the topic (_"Nowadays, more tasks at home and work are being performed by robots."_).
2. **Main Body 1**: Answer the first question (_"I think this is happening because..."_).
3. **Main Body 2**: Answer the second question (_"I believe this is a positive/negative development because..."_).
4. **Conclusion**: Summarize your answers.

## How to Analyze a Question

1. **Find the topic**: Identify the general subject (e.g., technology).
2. **Find the keywords**: Pinpoint the focus (e.g., robots working for humans).
3. **Understand the instructions**: What does the examiner want you to do? For example, here they want you to give your opinion.

### How to Decide Your Answer

1. **Think before you start writing** — your answer reflects your thinking.
2. **Keep it simple**: The simplest, most straightforward answer is often the best.
3. **Write about what you know**: Focus on ideas you can expand on with some knowledge.
4. **Choose one side**: If asked to take a stance (e.g., "positive or negative development"), pick the easier one to support.

---

## How to Generate Ideas

1. **Prime your brain** to think logically and clearly.
2. **The most obvious ideas** are usually the best ones.
3. **Focus on relevance**:
    - Are your ideas directly answering the question?
    - Can you develop them fully?
    - Is your language accurate?
4. **Ask direct, specific questions about the prompt** to generate relevant ideas.
5. **Your first ideas are often the best**.

#### Example:

_"Nowadays, more tasks at home and work are being performed by robots."_

- **Why is this happening?** Technological advancement.
- **Is it a positive or negative development?**
    - Negative: It lays off people from their jobs.
    - Positive: It reduces the amount of work humans need to do.

## Writing an Introduction

### What is an Introduction?

- Introduces the reader to your essay.
- Helps the reader follow the essay.
- Serves as a mini-plan for organizing your thoughts.

### What an Introduction is NOT

- **Not a showcase for fancy language**: Keep it simple to avoid mistakes that will lower the examiner's first impression.
- **Not a hook**: You don’t need to grab attention like in creative writing.

### Structure of a Double-Question Introduction

1. **Paraphrase the question**: State the same ideas using synonyms and/or change the sentence structure.  
    Example: _"Nowadays, more tasks at home and work are being performed by robots."_ can become _"Robotics increasingly play a role both at home and in the workplace."_
2. **Briefly answer both questions**:  
    Example: _"This is due to advancements in technology, and it should be seen as a positive development because it reduces a person’s workload."_
3. **Put it together**:  
    Example: _"Robotics increasingly play a role both at home and in the workplace. This is due to advancements in technology, and it should be seen as a positive development because it reduces a person’s workload."_
4. **Don’t list too many ideas**: The ideas in the introduction must match those in the body paragraphs. Stick to one idea per question.

## Writing the Main Body Paragraphs

### What is a Body Paragraph?

- The most important part of the essay where you develop your main arguments.
- This is where you prove your point(s).

### Structure of a Body Paragraph (for any question type)

1. **Topic sentence (main idea)**: 
	- Introduce the main point of the paragraph. (answer the question that  the paragraph is answering)
	- Should be short and simple
	- Avoid repeating phrases and words multiple times, use paraphrasing instead
2. **Explanation**: 
	- The most important part of the body
	- Never assume that the reader knows what your topic sentence means or that know how it answers the question
	- The reader cant ask you follow up questions, so you must explain everything
	- Pretend you are explaining to someone who doesn't know anything about the topic
	- To know which explanations you need to make, ask direct and specific questions to the topic sentence, and pick the questions that the reader is most likely going to ask, and answer them
3. **Example**: 
	- The examiner wants you to demonstrate that you **know how to use examples.
	- The examples must support or prove your main points
	- Examples do not need to be true but they must make sense (fictional examples) 
		- Example: *"Recent research concluded that/A recent study found that......+ what you are trying to prove"*

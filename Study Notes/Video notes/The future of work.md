[The Future Of Work (Avoid Learning These Skills) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS9qrdJLdmU&t=712s)
  
- Entry level jobs are going instinct, the tasks are going to be satisfied by AI, the bar for entry level is raised to junior or even senior level, so to land a job u need prior experience, the admissible people are the highly skilled ones with selectable trades  
- if you don't create a purpose, you'll be assigned one
- goals aren't static, they change and develop as you gain experience  
- a goal is a purpose that you choose, some people are programmed since childhood to achieve goals that are made by the government or society, like be a good worker and a good citizen  
- to achieve a goal you need a set of skills to learn, if you don't choose a goal, you don't get to choose what to learn or which problems to solve, your brain stays narrow by default because the goal is narrow, your destiny is decided for you because the only potential you know is the potential you were assigned  
- the future of work is one person businesses  
- a business is a legal structure that allows you to: 1. Build what you want 2. Solve valuable problems 3. Profit from both  
- the thought of entrepreneurship being reserved only for people with a certain mindset and trades is false, even introverts can be entrepreneurs in this era.  
- building a business or being an entrepreneur is being valuable, packaging up that value and engage in value exchange

"Traditional education and hyperspecialization is the way to make people subservient to the dominant system. Study the general principals of nature and be a deep generalist "  

pirates give a great example on entrepreneurship, they knew the sea, the land, ships, biology, geography, navigation, astronomy, treasures, crew management... And their crew were chosen stupid on purpose, so they are narrow minded and do as they are told, and get assigned roles, for example a "royal treasurer", they become happy when given the title and it narrows their minds even more, becoming specialists makes them lose the ability to do their own thing because they lack the other skills.
Land people know only the land, and believe what pirates say, pirates can lie and control both land and sea because they r generalists, land people cant because they are specialists.  

schools were created to enslave the brightest minds promising them the prestige of specialization, so they remain narrow minded and lack the ability to overthrow those who assigned to them their purpose.

"Do it all, become it all"
The internet gave the individual the power to learn anything, fast and effectively. We are living through the second renaissance

These skills need to be adopted and be integrated in your own identity

To learn these, we can learn these following skills that require these liberating arts.
### 1. Marketing and sales
if you don't know how to attract and persuade, you will never get what you want, and the only option for you is for an employer (or the government) to give it to you.
**(Rhetoric, psychology)**
### 2. Writing and thinking
The ability to communicate the value in your unique mind. The foundation of getting in front of other people.
**(Logic, research)**
### 3. Entrepreneurship
The process of taking any future into your own hands, hunting for your survival and building products that you want to see in the world (that others care about).
**(Statistics, agency, investment)**

	Entrepreneurship is a meta skill that makes you learn other important things, making you unemployable (you wont want to be employed again because it doesnt make sense anymore because you can make more on you own and have control over your lifestyle)
	A meta skill is a skill that allows you to learn more skills and improve existing ones, like communication, innovation, creativity..

No one can teach you how to write or sell or market or think, they can only show you how they do it. ==If you want to learn any skills and specifically these skills, you have to embrace a self-experimentation mindset, you cant watch tutorials all day; you gotta experiment and try and fail until you learn== 

### Research processes that others found success with
read books, use google, watch tutorials. ==Self education should be a 30-60 minute habit daily!==
### Experiment with various techniques 
Implement the processes you learned and attempt to get results
### Identify patterns and principles
Note the similarities between each and double down on them
### Create your own process 
Tailor what you learn to your unique lifestyle and situation
### Contribute to true education by passing it down

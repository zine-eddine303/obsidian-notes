[The Future Of Work (Avoid Learning These Skills) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS9qrdJLdmU&t=712s)
  
- Entry level jobs are going instinct, the tasks are going to be satisfied by AI, the bar for entry level is raised to junior or even senior level, so to land a job u need prior experience, the admissible people are the highly skilled ones with selectable trades  
- if you don't create a purpose, you'll be assigned one
- goals aren't static, they change and develop as you gain experience  
- a goal is a purpose that you choose, some people are programmed since childhood to achieve goals that are made by the government or society, like be a good worker and a good citizen  
- to achieve a goal you need a set of skills to learn, if you don't choose a goal, you don't get to choose what to learn or which problems to solve, your brain stays narrow by default because the goal is narrow, your destiny is decided for you because the only potential you know is the potential you were assigned  
- the future of work is one person businesses  
- a business is a legal structure that allows you to: 1. Build what you want 2. Solve valuable problems 3. Profit from both  
- the thought of entrepreneurship being reserved only for people with a certain mindset and trades is false, even introverts can be entrepreneurs in this era.  
- building a business or being an entrepreneur is being valuable, packaging up that value and engage in value exchange  
# 1. Future proof work  
"Traditional education and hyperspecialization is the way to make people subservient to the dominant system. Study the general principals of nature and be a deep generalist "  

pirates give a great example on entrepreneurship, they knew the sea, the land, ships, biology, geography, navigation, astronomy, treasures, crew management... And their crew were chosen stupid on purpose, so they are narrow minded and do as they are told, and get assigned roles, for example a "royal treasurer", they become happy when given the title and it narrows their minds even more, becoming specialists makes them lose the ability to do their own thing because they lack the other skills.
Land people know only the land, and believe what pirates say, pirates can lie and control both land and sea because they r generalists, land people cant because they are specialists.  

schools were created to enslave the brightest minds promising them the prestige of specialization, so they remain narrow minded and lack the ability to overthrow those who assigned to them their purpose.
# 2. Do it all, become it all

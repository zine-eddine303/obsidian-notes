From looking at algerian web developers, i noticed that they lack the design aspect, completely. Also they always tend to have an agency that is most likely run by them only (one person agency). I should think if i can use the same method or i should work as a person directly, maybe do a survey to find out. ^ee0cb3

Just a thought: make the websites a monthly subscription instead of a one time payment, or instead find a way to keep the customer hooked and make him pay you for other services or features

I must study the market pricing (what the opponents are charging for the same service) ^8c49c6

We could make multiple revenue sources, like a monthly service to actual customers

We learned from key partners in [[Business Model Generation#^8ac589]] that *maybe* [Hostinger]([Hostinger - Bring Your Idea Online With a Website](https://www.hostinger.com/)) is considered a partner, so maybe we can find if they offer a deal for developers like me, or an affiliate thing! ^54fa86

**Update:** we did and we found a referral program that gives us 20% of what the customer payed

Do we have to give the client access to his website?
If it is an ecommerce website, we obviously should, ==but should be give him global access or only as a shop owner?==

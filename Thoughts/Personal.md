When most people decide to learn something, they go and pay for workshops, ask people to show them how, pay for online courses. They lack the skills and the ability to: 
1. Research a topic
2. Self learn
3. Find useful resources to learn
4. Find workarounds to avoid paying for digital services like software or learning resources
This makes me different and more advantageous than most people, specially here in Algeria.

I gotta divide my time, its chaotic right now
there's a lot of things that i should do: learning technical things, learning business management, working on the business, learning productivity..

lets say i have 6h a day of productivity:
2h of technical learning (like how to use gsap) 
2h of business learning (like business model)
2h of actual work on the business (preparation, design, portfolio...)

Not being narcissitic but ==bro I am smart==, I get things quickly and make assumptions that almost turn out to be true. Don't ask me why, but I have high potential, I just have to work it out and use it.

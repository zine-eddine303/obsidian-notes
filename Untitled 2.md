The graph illustrates the proportion of spending of average households for three different ranges of income. 

Overall, low, medium and high income households spend on housing more than any other commodities, taking almost a third of their income. Furthermore, richer households put more significant parts of their money on retirement savings in comparison to they other two categories.

Food, utilities and health bills take a larger proportion of low income families' money compared to the other groups. For example, food takes 7% more than it takes for richer households. Additionally, low income families dedicate little to no money to save for their retirement, valued by only 3% of their low salaries.

In contrast, higher income households put almost a fifth of their income on retirement, which makes it seven times more than what households with low income have saved. We can also mention that this richer segment spend slightly more on education, and less on transport.

Finally, the medium income group is mostly in between the other two segments, and also are notably spending equally - proportion wise - to the high income category in health and eating out.

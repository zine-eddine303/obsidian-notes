- Everything is growing with years, except fluctuations in rice
- Barley is the fasstets growing, doubling by 2030
- Maize is the slowest
- Wheat is the most produced every year rice is the least


The given table shows grains production between 2010 and 2015, extended by projections until 2030 measured in million metric tons.

Wheat is the most produced type of grain in 2010 and 2015, and is expected keep this caracteristic until 2030. In 2010, 100 million tons of wheat has been produced, and grew by 5% after 5 years. It is estimated that the production of this grain will keep growing slowly until reaching 110 million metric tons by 2030.

Barley production is estimated to double by 2030, staring at 50 million metric tons in 2010, and increasing by 15 million on average every 5 years. However, maize is the slowest growing grain in production with a projected augmentation of half a million tons in 10 years (34 million in 2010 and 35 million by 2030). 

Finally, rice production dropped from 24.7 to 24.3 million metric tons from 2010 to 2015, but it is expected to grow slighly to 25.5 millions by year 2030.

Overall, the production of all types of grains increased from 2010 to 2015, and are expected to keep growing until 2030. Wheat is the most produced grain, while rice is the least produced one.

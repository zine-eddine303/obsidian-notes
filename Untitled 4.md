# G12

- **What is this about?**  
    If you run a business under the "Impôt Forfaitaire Unique" (IFU) system in Algeria, you need to estimate and report how much money (sales or professional income) you think you'll make for the year. This is called a **prévisionnelle déclaration**.
    
- **What document do you use?**  
    You'll fill out a specific form called **"Série G n°12"**.
    
- **Where do you submit it?**  
    You take this form to the **tax office** or **the nearest tax center** where your business is located.
    
- **When is the deadline?**  
    You must submit this form **before June 30th** every year.
    
- **What happens next?**
    
    - You submit **two copies** of the form:
        - One goes to the tax office.
        - The other stays with you, but only after the tax office **stamps it** to confirm you've paid any required amounts.
- **Why is this important?**  
    It helps the tax authorities know what to expect in terms of your tax payments and keeps your business compliant with tax laws.


# G12 bis

- **What is this about?**  
    After the year ends, businesses under the **Impôt Forfaitaire Unique (IFU)** system need to report their **actual revenue** (how much money they really made) for the year. This is done with a form called **"Série G n°12 bis"**.
    
- **When do you need to file it?**  
    You must submit this **final declaration** by **January 20th of the following year**.
    
- **What happens if your actual revenue is higher than your estimate?**
    
    - If your actual revenue (declared in this final form) is **more than the estimate** you reported earlier (on the "Série G n°12"), you’ll need to pay the extra tax (called **impôt complémentaire**) right when you file this final declaration.
- **How many copies are required?**
    
    - **Two copies** of this form are needed:
        - One goes to the tax office.
        - The other is stamped by the tax office and returned to you as proof of submission and payment (if applicable).
- **Why is this important?**  
    This ensures that your taxes are calculated correctly based on what your business actually earned, not just the estimate you provided earlier. It’s a way to settle your accounts with the tax authorities for the year.

# Quick summary

- **Filing the G12 (Estimated Revenue):**
    
    - When you submit the **G12** form (by June 30), you estimate how much revenue your business will earn for the year.
    - You pay taxes **based on this estimated revenue** at the time of filing.

- **Filing the G12 bis (Actual Revenue):**
    
    - After the year ends, you file the **G12 bis** form (by January 20 of the following year).
    - This reports the **real revenue** your business earned during the year.

- **If Actual Revenue > Estimated Revenue:**
    
    - If your **real revenue** is higher than your **estimated revenue**, you owe **additional taxes** on the difference.
    - You pay this extra tax (called **impôt complémentaire**) when submitting the G12 bis.

- **If Actual Revenue ≤ Estimated Revenue:**
    
    - If your **real revenue** is equal to or less than the estimated amount, you don’t pay anything extra. You're already covered.
      Unfortunately, under the **Impôt Forfaitaire Unique (IFU)** system in Algeria, **if your actual revenue is less than the estimated revenue**, you generally **do not get a refund** for the extra tax you paid. The tax authorities treat the estimated tax you paid as final, even if your business earned less than expected.
      
      This is because the IFU system is simplified and based on **estimates** rather than a detailed reconciliation process like other tax regimes. It's designed for smaller businesses to reduce administrative burden, but one of its trade-offs is that **overpaid taxes are not reimbursed**.
      
      So, it’s important to provide a realistic and conservative estimate in your **G12 declaration** to avoid overpaying.

# Déclaration des nouveaux contribuables

- **Who is this for?**  
    This applies to **new businesses** or individuals who just started their activity under the **Impôt Forfaitaire Unique (IFU)** system.
    
- **What is required?**
    
    - As a new taxpayer, you only need to submit the **final declaration** (called **"Série G n°12 bis"**) to report the **actual revenue** your business earned during its first year.
- **When is the deadline?**
    
    - You must submit this declaration by **January 20 of the year following** the year you started your business. For example:
        - If you started your business in 2024, you must file the declaration by January 20, 2025.
- **What about paying taxes?**
    
    - When you submit the G12 bis form, you also pay the **entire amount of tax** owed for your first year, based on the revenue you report.
    - This payment is made **spontaneously** (meaning you calculate it and pay without being asked).
- **Why is this important?**
    
    - It ensures that new businesses meet their tax obligations from the start and pay the appropriate amount for their first year of operations. This is a legal requirement under **Article 3 Bis of the CPF (Code des Procédures Fiscales)**.

## **Example:**

- You started your business on **November 17, 2024**.
- Between November 17 and December 31, you earned 500,000 DZD.
- By January 20, 2025, you must:
    - Submit the **G12 bis** form reporting the 500,000 DZD as your revenue.
    - Pay the tax owed on this revenue.
